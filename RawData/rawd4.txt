INTRODUCTION
Background of the Study
A Web-Based GIS Mapping and forecasting the utilization of medicine at Rural Health Units (RHUs) is a critical aspect of healthcare delivery, particularly in rural areas where access to healthcare is often limited. In Cauayan City, Isabela, this is particularly relevant due to the rural nature of the community and the challenges in accessing basic healthcare delivery services. By understanding how medicine is being utilized at RHUs, healthcare providers can better plan and allocate resources to meet the healthcare needs of the local population. This analysis involves the use of data mining techniques to analyze patterns and trends in medicine utilization at RHUs Cauayan City, Isabela.
Cauayan City is a third-class city located in the province of Isabela, Philippines. It has a population of approximately 141,913 (2023) people and is known for its agricultural economy. Like many other rural areas, Cauayan City faces several challenges in healthcare delivery, including limited access to healthcare facilities, inadequate resources, and a shortage of healthcare professionals.
	The city's healthcare system is mainly composed of primary care facilities, including rural health units (RHUs). RHUs are the primary healthcare facilities in the Philippines, providing a range of services, including maternal and child health, family planning, immunization, and treatment of common illnesses. They are staffed by doctors, nurses, and other healthcare workers.
	One of the main challenges faced by RHUs in Cauayan City is the availability and utilization of medicines. Medicines are an essential component of healthcare, and their availability can significantly affect the quality of care provided. However, RHUs often face shortages of essential medicines, leading to suboptimal treatment and patient outcomes. This issue is compounded by the fact that there is a lack of data on the utilization of medicines in RHUs, making it difficult to plan for the procurement and distribution of medicines.
According to a study by Gonzales (2018), mapping the utilization of medicine in rural areas can help healthcare providers to understand the distribution of health resources, identify potential disparities, and allocate resources more effectively. The study found that mapping the utilization of medicine can be useful in identify areas where access to healthcare is limited, as well as areas where patients may be overusing medications.
A study published by Amoloza in 2018 titled "Mapping and Forecasting Medicine Utilization in Rural Health Units: A Tool for Public Health Planning" aimed to develop a tool for mapping and forecasting medicine utilization in rural health units in the Philippines. The study utilized a geographic information system (GIS) to map the utilization of medicine in different areas and created a predictive model to forecast future medicine utilization based on current data.
	The authors found that the tool could assist in identifying gaps in medicine supply and demand, which could help health officials plan for future medicine needs in rural areas. By mapping and forecasting medicine utilization, rural health units could allocate their resources more effectively, provide more targeted interventions, and ultimately improve access to medicine for residents.
In a separate study by Aziz (2019), predictive analytics were used to forecast medicine utilization in rural areas. The study found that predictive models could be used to identify patterns in medicine utilization over time, as well as to identify factors that may contributes to changes in medicine usage. This information can be used by healthcare providers to develop more effective strategies for managing medicine supplies and meeting the needs of patients.
. 	 Mapping and Forecasting Utilize Medicine at Rural Health Unit in Cauayan City, Isabela project is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it aims to address a critical healthcare issue, which is the inadequate utilization of medicine at the RHU. The RHU is responsible for providing primary healthcare services to a large population in the rural areas of Cauayan City, Isabela. However, the RHU faces several challenges that hinder the effective utilization of medicine, including inadequate data, limited resources, and poor healthcare infrastructure. This project seeks to address these challenges by using data to predict and improve the utilization of medicine at the RHU.
Secondly, this project is significant because it is a step towards using data and analytics to improve healthcare outcomes in rural areas. The use of data and Analytics is an emerging trend in healthcare, and this project seeks to demonstrate how data can be used to improve healthcare delivery to rural communities. By mapping and forecasting the utilization of medicine at the RHU, this project aims to provide insights into how data can be used to optimize healthcare delivery in rural areas.
	The implementation of mapping and forecasting the utilization of medicine in RHUs requires the collection and analysis of data on medicine utilization. This data can be collected through various means, including patient records, prescription data, and inventory records. Once collected, the data can be analyzed using statistical software to identify patterns and trends in medicine utilization.
	To ensure the successful implementation of mapping and forecasting medicine utilization, healthcare providers in Cauayan City must be trained on the use of statistical software and data analysis techniques. This can be done through training programs and workshops, which can be conducted by local health authorities or external organizations.
	The implementation of mapping and forecasting medicine utilization also requires the establishment of a data management system. This system should be designed to collect, store, and analyze data on medicine utilization in RHUs. It should also be user- friendly and accessible to healthcare providers, allowing them to easily access and analyze data.
The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the demand for medicine based on various factors such as patient demographics, prevalent diseases, and seasonal variations. This model will enable healthcare providers to plan and allocate resources more efficiently. Through the mapping and prediction of medicine utilization at RHUs in Cauayan City, Isabela, healthcare providers can make informed decisions about resource allocation and ensure that patients receive the care they need, when they need it. This will help to improve the overall health outcomes of the community, reduce healthcare costs, and improve access to healthcare services in rural areas.
The scope of the problem in implementing a web-based GIS mapping and forecasting system for medicine utilization at Rural Health Unit 1 in Cauayan City, Isabela, is significant. The rural health unit faces challenges in efficiently managing medicine distribution and forecasting future demand due to limited resources and geographic constraints. Implementing a web-based GIS system will enable real-time tracking of medicine inventory, optimizing supply chain management, and improving distribution efficiency. Additionally, the system will provide data-driven insights and forecasting capabilities to anticipate medicine demand, enabling proactive planning and reducing stockouts or wastage. Overall, this solution has the potential to ensure timely availability of medicines, and improve the health outcomes of the rural population.
