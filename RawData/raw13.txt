ABSTRACT

The study entitled "Human Resources Information System for Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), Cauayan City, Isabela" helps the admin input employees's data. The work of the study will be reduced, as will the queue time of the employees who want the service of the office.

The main purpose of this is to develop and implement the proposed research entitled "Human Resources Information System for Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), Cauayan City, Isabela." Mainly, the study aimed to determine the listed problems encountered by the agency in the present system.

The methods used in gathering data were questionnaires, interviews, and observations. Based on the weighted mean and descriptive interpretations of the performance of the existing manual system, the department head and staff "agree" encountered plenty of problems.

The analysis shows that the pre-evaluation perception of the respondents on the Human Resources Information System for the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), Cauayan City, Isabela is "agree." The respondents agreed they encountered listed problems along the weighted mean (1.30).

Likewise, the post-evaluation perception of the respondents is "strongly agree" with the development of the record management system for the Human Resources Information System for the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP), Cauayan City, Isabela, in terms of performance (4.64), information (4.67), security (4.62), efficiency (4.71), and economics (4.70). The result of the post-evaluation. The respondents have certainly agreed that they used the current system along with the weighted mean (4.66).

Based on the summary, conclusion, and recommendations, most respondents believed there was a need to improve the present system. The existing manual system is not effective, as proven by the problems encountered and the need for an effective system for easier and more accurate transactions. The evaluation of the respondents gave the reason that there is a need to replace the manual system with the Human Resource Information System, a desktop application.

Hence, the development of a human resource information system is recommended by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) to address the problems encountered based on the study results.





CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

Project Context

The Human Resources Information System (HRIS) serves as a methodical approach to administering employee data, facilitating planning and decision-making, and generating reports for external entities. These integrated systems have significantly improved HR practices and facilitated easier access to employee information. However, there is limited research available on the extent to which HRIS effectively contributes to employee retention, motivation, and attraction (Galanaki et al., 2019).

The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) in Cauayan City, Isabela, has established clear guidelines, responsibilities, and accountability for developing and maintaining the country's safety program. This entails directives to plan, organize, develop, control, and continually enhance the State Safety Program of the Philippines to meet the state's safety requirements. Additionally, it outlines the necessary human and financial resources required for the implementation of the State Safety Program.

CAAP plays various roles in society, including establishing rules and regulations for aircraft inspection and registration, enforcing laws related to air transportation, setting charges for public air utility facilities, operating the Civil Aviation Training Centre (CATC), and performing other powers and functions as mandated by law.

The primary challenge faced by the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) in Cauayan City, Isabela, is the absence of a systematic employee information collection system. Currently, they manually input data such as leave, leave credits, loans, resumes, and certificates of training and seminars into Excel or ledgers. The manual system poses security risks and is time-consuming. The project aims to develop a human resources information system for CAAP's employees in Cauayan City, Isabela, enabling efficient dissemination of information by managers regarding various aspects of employee records.

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE AND STUDIES

Review of Related Literature and Studies

The researchers' study is related to the present system, emphasizing the importance of the Human Resources Information System in the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines in Cauayan City, Isabela. This chapter provides an in-depth understanding of the system and its benefits. This chapter also describes the factors and best practices involved in implementing a system. The studies listed below will assist the researcher in better assessing and constructing a system distinct from other systems. Moreover, it will help the researchers know better and understand what materials are appropriate for their system development. Furthermore, it will enable the construction of unique features that benefit employers and the manager through an effective system to disseminate information regarding an employee's leave, leave credits, benefits, and employee accounts.

As stated by Anon (2020), in today's environment, businesses, governmental bodies, and non-profit entities worldwide rely on Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS) to facilitate information exchange and streamline processes associated with downsizing and reengineering. HRIS is characterized by the integration of human resource management (HRM) and information systems (IS), offering HR managers a technologically driven, efficient, and systematic approach to the execution of HR functions.

According to Hagan et al. (2022), the Human Resource Information System (HRIS) stands out as a crucial component of Management Information Systems (MIS), significantly contributing to the delivery of human resource services within an organization. This research aims to pinpoint the challenges associated with this process. A survey, utilizing a closed-ended questionnaire, was conducted with 63 participants from the University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS) and Ho Technical University (HTU) to identify these challenges. The primary obstacle discovered in the adoption of HRIS is the lack of management support. Consequently, the study concludes that the absence of management support hinders the adoption of HRIS and recommends that management should actively engage and be educated on the significance of HRIS to enhance its adoption and functionality.

As per Anon (2020b), a Human Resource Information System (HRIS) serves as a software solution encompassing comprehensive employee information, along with the management and processing of data related to Human Resources policies and procedures. HRIS functions as the core system for Human Resource Management (HRM) and Centralized Core Human Resources (Core HR), facilitating the completion of essential employee master data processes. The software establishes a centralized repository for this information. Through the analysis of the complex structure using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method, it validates a cause-and-effect chain among elements, making it effective for identifying relationships and dependencies. Notably, factors such as HRM functions, software quality, vendor support, technology, and big data analysis are crucial for evaluation. The assessment preference places HRM functions at the forefront, while technology receives the lowest rank in the analysis results.

According to Lina (2019), human resources emerge as the paramount factor for any organization operating in the 21st century. With the escalating impact of globalization and technology, organizations are increasingly integrating information systems across various human resource functions. The Human Resource Information System (HRIS) is not a novel concept but rather an evolving one, adapting to the changing environment. It functions as a software solution for tasks like data entry, tracking, and managing diverse human resources information, including payroll, management, and accounting functions within an organization. An HRIS enhances planning effectiveness, offers control over HR costs, achieves heightened efficiency and excellence in decision-making, and elevates employee and managerial productivity. Notably, the primary advantage of HRIS lies in its capacity to store extensive employee data, aiding the strategic activities of HR managers, particularly in areas like training and development, applicant tracking during recruitment and selection, and human resource planning.

From Razad's (2021) perspective, the complexities inherent in human resource management and the rapid advancements in science and technology have spurred the swift development of Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS). The archaic, unscientific, slow, and insufficient nature of data preservation and information systems related to employees in organizations has undergone a significant transformation. As a result, the importance of a Human Resource Information System (HRIS) has become immensely critical, particularly amidst intensifying global competition in business, industry, commerce, and international trade. At the national level, it has contributed to enhanced economic viability and cost-effectiveness and facilitated the streamlined administration of both public and private organizations. The ongoing evolution and enhancement of various computer components, encompassing both hardware and software integral to information technology, seamlessly align with the growing volume of record-keeping in human resources mandated by laws and statutes. Additionally, the sustained availability of affordable computer technology, including hardware, further substantiates these advancements (Rashid, 2021).

As indicated by Pertiwi and Yulianingsih (2020), a Human Resources Information System (HRIS) functions as a comprehensive system tasked with managing all information pertaining to human resources within an institution. This research aims to assess and evaluate the existing system, examining the relationship between variables using the HOT Fit method among HRIS users in KPKNL Palembang. The model comprises three independent variables, each with its own sub-variables: human variables with system users (PS) and user satisfaction (KP), organizational variables with organizational structure (SO) and organizational environment (LO), and technology variables with system quality (KS), quality information (IC), and service quality (KL). Additionally, there are dependent variables, with net benefit being the primary focus of this research. Utilizing quantitative descriptive research methods involving observation, interviews, and the distribution of questionnaires, this study employs a Likert scale to measure employee attitudes and perceptions, with all 38 civil servants (PNS) serving as the sample. The authors anticipate that the findings from this study will provide the institution with valuable insights for refining the current system.

As outlined by Ahmad and Ali (2019), the research seeks to elucidate the role of the human resources information system (specifically in the fields of activities, employees, employees as a whole, and positions) within the realm of human resource management (HRM) practices, encompassing areas such as recruitment, performance evaluation, training, and compensation and incentive activities. The primary research issue revolves around the inadequacy of the HRM strategy due to information gaps. The investigation operates under two key assumptions, aiming to explore the correlation and influence between the identified research variables by analyzing responses from a sample comprising 64 faculty teachers at the University of Cihan-Erbil. The data analysis involves the utilization of the SPSS program and various statistical methods, including arithmetic mean, standard deviation, repetition, percentages, correlation coefficient, and a simple linear regression equation. Key findings of the study include establishing the relationship and impact of the human resources information system on human resource strategy practices. The researcher recommends an increase in attention and investment in the human resources information system due to its pivotal role in activating and enhancing human resources strategy practices.

As noted by Magege and Ngirwa (2023), the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) has emerged as a crucial element in Human Resource Management (HRM), particularly in developing economies like Tanzania. Although various organizations have adopted this system, there is a scarcity of evaluations regarding its impact on organizational performance. This paper presents findings on the utility of the Human Resources Information System (HRIS) within the banking sector, with a focus on Azania Bank Limited. The study aimed to explore the significance of HRIS for the performance of Azania Bank Limited. Based on descriptive research targeting 133 respondents from all employees at ABL headquarters, structured questionnaires were employed for data collection. The collected data underwent both descriptive and inferential analysis using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Additionally, correlation and regression analyses were conducted based on predetermined regression models. The results indicated a noteworthy improvement in employees' and management's access to human resource data across the institution due to HRIS utilization. A highly significant improvement (p<0.001) in working standards was also identified as a result of HRIS implementation. The study concludes that HRIS is pivotal in organizational contexts, supported by significant positive correlations (R = 0.889) between organization performance and the importance of HRIS. However, some employees faced challenges using HRIS due to low computer literacy. The study recommends that Azania Bank Limited should invest in enhancing employee computer literacy and involve them in tailoring the organizational system through analysis, design, construction, and development of the system to enhance overall performance.

According to Bhatia and Nangia (2023), this paper explores the influence of the human resource information system on human resource strategies. The HRIS functions as a tool designed to address the fundamental needs of businesses, efficiently catering to the requirements of both managers and employees. With a specific focus on the banking industry, this paper underscores that while banking organizations are increasingly integrating this software for the benefit of their employees, there remains a resistance among individuals within the industry toward its adoption. In the current organizational landscape, the primary objective is to boost employee morale and acquaint them with new technologies, ultimately contributing to optimal organizational outcomes. The research presented in this paper offers insights into select banking sectors that have already embraced technology. It particularly concentrates on understanding the reasons behind employees' resistance to adopting new technological software in today's scenario.

CHAPTER III

DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY

This chapter presents the design and methodology employed in the study. It encompasses several sections, including requirement analysis, requirement documentation, technical background (covering materials, software, hardware, data, use case diagram, fishbone diagram, system flowchart, and entity relationship diagram), design of software and systems, software development methodology, development and testing, data gathering procedures, data analysis plans, different software testing, description of the prototype, system architecture, implementation plan, and implementation results.

Requirement Analysis

This is the process of determining system requirements by tracking the existing system, having discussions with potential users, performing task analysis, and so on. This may entail the creation of one or more different system models.

Data Flow Diagram

Figure 2. Data Flow Diagram

The figure above - Figure 2. Data Flow Diagram, depicts the overall flow of the software system. The system grants the administrator full access to all the system's operations. Upon initiating the login process, the system verifies the administrator's credentials entered in the designated text fields, cross-referencing them with the user accounts stored in the database table known as "tbl user." If the credentials are confirmed, the administrator gains entry to the dashboard, where various operations can be executed. The administrator has the option to register additional accounts for different employees. When the necessary data for creating a new account is provided by the administrator, it is stored in the "tbl user" table. Furthermore, the administrator can add employees to the system, and their corresponding data is stored in the "tbl_profile," which serves as a repository for all registered employees under the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP). The administrator also has access to manage employee accounts, profiles,and leaves, with the relevant data being retrieved from the "tbl profile" table. In the event that the administrator changes an employee's status to inactive, the associated data is automatically removed from the "tbl_profile" table and transferred to the "tbl_history," marking the employee as resigned or retired from the aforementioned agency.

Fishbone Diagram

Figure 3. Fishbone Diagram

The figure above is Figure 3. The fishbone diagram illustrates that every issue associated with employing a manual system has a corresponding cause and effect in the diagram above. The manual system is slow to access since it uses up so much space in terms of performance, and filing documents manually takes a lot of time. In addition to collecting and storing the file, finding the information when you need it takes time, which could range from a few minutes to several hours depending on the organization's level of organization. This inefficiency can irritate both customers and staff, leading to decreased productivity. Furthermore, manual systems often lack advanced analytical capabilities, which hampers the extraction of meaningful insights from document data. Identifying trends, patterns, or opportunities for improvement becomes challenging without proper analytics insights. Another drawback is the lack of version control mechanisms in manual systems. When multiple individuals need to work on a document simultaneously or revisions are made, it becomes difficult to track and manage different versions. This can result in confusion and errors due to outdated or conflicting information. Moreover, manual systems pose security risks. Physical documents can be lost, stolen, or damaged, leaving the information vulnerable. Additionally, controlling access to sensitive information becomes more challenging, increasing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches. The source of incomplete information is frequently damaged or misplaced. Making changes when working with paper documents is much more difficult. Each time you want to change the order, you must make a copy in order to prevent wiping the original with any changes or annotations you could make. This suggests that editing requires more time than it would with digital versions. Furthermore, manual systems have several drawbacks. They are prone to errors such as mistiling, loss, or damage of documents, which can lead to the loss of valuable information and hinder the maintenance of accurate records. Additionally, physical documents require significant storage space, leading to space constraints and a cluttered work environment as document volumes increase. Furthermore, manual systems restrict accessibility to specific locations and limited hours, causing difficulties for individuals who require remote or after-hours access to information. Economics-wise, printing and paper are expensive. As a result, the cost is higher because using paper documents requires purchasing paper and ink, which will increase your expenses. Your costs for office supplies will be higher if you manually file documents. Despite the fact that you may think this is inconsequential, it eventually adds up to a sizable chunk of money that may be put to better use. Moreover, manual systems in economies bring increased operational costs due to the need for additional resources like physical storage space, filing cabinets, and personnel. These costs rise with the volume of documents, and the labor-intensive nature of manual handling can result in higher labor costs. Moreover, manual systems lead to reduced productivity and efficiency compared to digital systems, as manual processes are slower and require more labor. This impacts tasks such as document retrieval, information search, and data processing, hindering productivity in financial reporting, auditing, and data analysis. Additionally, manual systems have a higher risk of errors and inaccuracies, including data entry mistakes, calculation errors, and document misplacement. Such errors can have significant consequences, causing incorrect decisions, financial losses, legal issues, or reputational damage in economic processes like financial reporting, tax compliance, or budgeting. In terms of security and control, a deficiency in security may result in less safeguarded data. Hard-copy filing can be less secure than computerized filing. It is easy for lost documents to end up in the wrong hands. Customers expect you to protect their private information. If you are unable to safeguard this, you face the risk of losing them. A filing cabinet is easier to use than a computer, which requires a password and other login details. Limited access control makes it difficult to restrict access to sensitive documents, increasing the possibility of unauthorized disclosure or alteration. Furthermore, manual systems offer limited confidentiality compared to digital systems.

Physical documents can be read or copied by anyone with physical access, lacking the encryption and advanced security measures found in digital systems. Additionally, retrieving information from a manual system is slower. Manually searching through files and documents is time-consuming and prone to errors, impacting operational efficiency and timely decision-making. Records are inaccurate with efficiency; therefore, it takes time to make adjustments or modifications. Receiving and finding the right product is essential for efficient warehouse operations and a happy client. Manual systems encounter challenges such as slow document processing, increased administrative workload, and difficulty in document search and retrieval. The physical handling of documents causes delays, impacting productivity. More administrative tasks are required, diverting resources from critical activities. Finding specific documents within a manual system is time-consuming and inefficient.

The feedback phase allows for continuous iteration and improvement of the software based on user input, ultimately aiming to deliver an optimal and satisfactory user experience.

Development and Testing

Data Gathering Procedure

The data gathering procedure will involve administering Likert scale surveys to collect data at both the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) and a school.

Participants will be selected through a convenient sampling technique from the target populations in each setting. The surveys will be distributed to the participants, who will be asked to rate their level of agreement or disagreement with a series of statements related to the research objectives. The surveys will be administered either in person or through an online platform, ensuring confidentiality and anonymity. Clear instructions will be provided to participants on how to complete the surveys accurately. Once the data collection period is complete, the Likert scale responses will be compiled and analyzed to generate insights and draw meaningful conclusions about the attitudes and opinions of the participants at CAAP and the school

Data Analysis Plan

After gathering data, the statistical tools that will be used in the analysis of the data are the weighted arithmetic mean, standard deviation, analysis variance (ANOVA), and Pearson product-moment coefficient correlation. The weighted arithmetic mean will be used to determine the average responses for each of the five (5) options in each item in the questionnaire, namely, 5 (strongly agree/very good/very willing/very high), 4 (agree/good/willing/high), 3 (undecided/fair), 2 (disagree/hesitant/low/poor), and 1 (strongly disagree/very hesitant/very low/very poor). The Likert scale can be generated by means of the respondents' replication of the survey.
