INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background of the Study
The resident data that include factors such as existing and past health conditions, and total number of recorded health center consultations play a crucial role in shaping individuals’ well-being and overall health. The World Health Organization (WHO) in an article from 2022 stated that aging is a result from the impact of the accumulation of a wide variety of molecule and cellular damage over time. This leads to a gradual decrease in physical and mental capacity, and growing risk of disease. Obtaining a medical history can reveal chronic illnesses and other prior disease states fir which the patient may not be under treatment but may have had lasting effects on the patient’s health. The medical history may also direct differential diagnoses (Nichol Junior, et al., 2023). Understanding how these factors interact and impact health outcomes is essential for policymakers, public health professionals, and urban planners to develop effective strategies to addressing health disparities and improving population health. Policies addressing the social determinants of health and health equity play a significant role in improving the well-being of individuals, especially in child and youth health and education (Littleton & Reader, 2022).
Information and data gathered from health mapping, allow researchers to integrate diverse datasets, including past and occurring health conditions with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The resident data that include factors such as existing and past health conditions, and total number of recorded health center consultations play a crucial role in shaping individuals' well-being and overall health.  By incorporating the spatial dimension, it becomes possible to represent spatial patterns, hotspots, and spatial data that may otherwise remain hidden. This research aims to leverage the health mapping technique to uncover and enable more efficient strategies and interventions against diseases. Obtaining a medical history can reveal the relevant chronic illnesses and other prior disease states for which the patient may not be under treatment but may have had lasting effects on the patient's health. The medical history may also direct differential diagnoses. (Nichol JR, et al., 2023) Understanding how these factors interact and impact health outcomes is essential for policymakers, public health professionals, and urban planners to develop effective strategies for addressing health disparities and improving population health. By pinpointing geographic areas with high health disparities influenced by occurring health conditions, policymakers can allocate resources more effectively and implement targeted interventions to improve health outcomes and reduce health inequities within specific geographic areas and boundaries.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
2.1	Review of Related Literature
Based on The Study “Applying Health Mapping for the Residents of San Fermin, Cauayan City, Isabela”, the following references are relevant and appropriate for the review:
2.1.1 Significance of GIS to health mapping systems
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) play a significant role in public health by providing a powerful tool for mapping and analyzing health-related data. GIS enables the visualization and analysis of spatial data, allowing for a better understanding of the relationship between the built environment and health outcomes (Boggs et al., 2022). It has been widely used to elucidate the underlying geography of health disparities, which may not be evident through traditional statistical analyses (Rosales et al., 2019). 
In the context of contagious disease epidemics, GIS mapping assists in monitoring trends and patterns, providing valuable information for public health decision-makers, travelers, and local populations at risk (Shariati et al., 2020). Furthermore, GIS has been adopted increasingly in diverse health-related domains and national settings, aiming to improve responses to public health problems (KS et al., 2022). The significance of GIS in health mapping is evident in various applications, such as analyzing socio-economic and geographical factors affecting the health of the elderly, monitoring disease outbreaks, and assessing the availability and accessibility of health services (Dermatis et al., 2020; Rajapakshe et al., 2019; Rohsulina et al., 2022). 
GIS has also been instrumental in spatial modeling of disease prevalence, environmental factors influencing disease transmission, and the mapping of geographical distributions of diseases (Parandin et al., 2022; Tewara et al., 2019). Moreover, GIS has been used to create digital maps for the distribution of minerals, mapping and complaint of damaged roads, and surveillance of infectious agents in hospitals (Puspitasari et al., 2022; Winarta et al., 2021; Silva et al., 2021). During the COVID-19 pandemic, GIS has played a critical role in understanding the spatial clustering and transmission trends of the disease. It has been utilized for near-real-time case tracking and documentation, as well as for the analysis of geographical patterns of disease incidence and prevalence (Ahasan & Hossain, 2021; Franch-Pardo et al., 2020). 
2.1.2	Health Mapping to Public Health
Health mapping offers various advantages and contributes to public health. Process mapping has been highlighted as advantageous for planning projects in healthcare, as it allows for the identification of areas of need and resources for targeted public health efforts (Connors et al., 2021). Participatory mapping has been demonstrated as a potent methodology for diagnosing place-based determinants of health disparities (Douglas et al., 2020). In addition, asset mapping approaches have been widely employed in public health, medicine, and other social and behavioral sciences to map local assets and ensure community participation in public health promotion strategies (Healy et al., 2023; Agdal et al.,2019). 
Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping has been identified as an affordable and efficient method to identify areas of need and resources for targeted public health efforts, particularly in vision-related public health initiatives (Connors et al., 2021). Digital mapping using GIS technology for health emergency monitoring has been recognized for its advantages in addressing public health challenges, such as the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic (López et al., 2021; Smith & Mennis, 2020). The use of mapping tools has been found to facilitate health policy planning and identify evidence gaps for future studies, contributing to public health research and practice (Ibiapina et al., 2022; Dick et al., 2020).
2.1.3 Health Mapping using GIS as a tool for intervention of health issues
Health mapping technology using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has emerged as a valuable tool for intervening in health issues. GIS allows for the visualization and analysis of health data, enabling the identification of priority areas for intervention and the mapping of patient addresses to reveal areas in need of targeted health interventions (Banerjee et al., 2022). Utilizing to understand the spatial distribution of diseases such as tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus, aiding in the identification of risk factors and targets for public health intervention (Rosales et al., 2019). Additionally, GIS has been instrumental in spatial epidemiology, assisting in the identification and spatial analysis of diseases, such as dengue fever, to guide disease intervention strategies (Sulistyawati, 2020).
GIS has been employed to improve urban air quality through green infrastructure, offering specific policy interventions to enhance air quality (Hewitt et al., 2019). It has been used to analyze geographic accessibility for informing radiotherapy planning, demonstrating its value in healthcare decision-making and treatment planning for cancer patients (Hande et al., 2022). GIS has been leveraged to mitigate COVID-19 contact tracing and surveillance challenges, showcasing its adaptability in addressing emerging health crises (Akpan et al., 2022).
2.1.4 Policymakers using health mapping technologies
Health mapping GIS data plays a crucial role in informing policymakers about health intervention and resource allocation. Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies have been shown to be effective in mapping regional differences in attributes such as disease burden, environmental exposures, and access to health care services, which can help in suggesting appropriate priorities for public health interventions (Makful, 2019). GIS aids in location-based support for public health preparedness programs, including decisions, resource allocation, communication, collaboration, and civic participation, which are essential for planning, response, and recovery in public health emergencies (Bhattacharya,2023).
GIS-based disease mapping serves as an effective tool for communication in public health and planning disease surveillance strategies, enabling the equitable allocation of healthcare resources to those most in need and ensuring accessibility to basic health services (Zuhdi et al., 2021). 	Furthermore, GIS can be used to identify locations with inadequate access to healthcare, informing health resource allocation and ensuring optimal locations for healthcare services (Nicholson et al., 2023). Additionally, GIS mapping combined with publicly available data has been effective in identifying health service shortage areas for targeted public health programming (Connors etal.,2021).
The use of GIS to improve public health emergency response during the COVID-19 crisis has been explored, particularly in optimizing the allocation of public health resources in rural settings using a data-driven approach that considers the multifactorial demand for new COVID-19 testing sites (Carbajales-Dale et al., 2023). Moreover, GIS has been utilized to identify social risks and align clinical services to patients' needs, although there is a paucity of literature regarding GIS use to address social risk factors in clinical settings (Ngongo et al.,2023).
	In terms of resource allocation, GIS has been instrumental in assessing the distribution of mental health beds, guiding mental health resource allocation policies by considering demographic and geographical distributions and influencing factors (Fan et al., 2022). It has also been used to inform health benefits package design for progressing towards Universal Health Coverage, providing actionable policy recommendations regarding spending allocations across specific delivery platforms, disease programs, and interventions (Fraser-Hurt et al., 2021).
2.1.5 Likert Scale
A Likert scale is a commonly used psychometric tool that enables researchers to assess attitudes, perceptions, opinions, and behaviors. Typically, this scale comprises a series of statements or items to which respondents express their level of agreement or disagreement. The responses are structured on a 5-point scale, ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree" (Ong et al., 2021). Likert scales are valuable in research as they offer a quantitative measurement of qualitative data, facilitating statistical analysis and comparison ("Likert Scale in Social Sciences Research: Problems and Difficulties", 2022).
2.1.6 Standard Deviation
Standard deviation is a crucial statistical measure when analyzing data obtained from Likert scales, particularly in the context of achieving consensus. The Likert scale, a widely used measurement tool in social sciences research, offers versatile options for data analysis ("Likert Scale in Social Sciences Research: Problems and Difficulties", 2022; Lahnamäki-Kivelä & Kuhmonen, 2022). When responses on a Likert scale show a decrease in standard deviation and an increase in mean towards consensus, it indicates a convergence of opinions or attitudes (Centeno et al., 2021). This trend towards reduced variability and a more central tendency signifies a movement towards agreement among respondents regarding the measured construct.

SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
 Summary
The researchers discussed the phases of development of the study as stated in the previous chapters and the application of Health Mapping Technology for the residents of Barangay San Fermin, Cauayan City, Isabela presents a promising and innovative approach to healthcare distribution and interventions to health issues occurring in the barangay, utilizing Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and spatial data and technology. The study demonstrated the potential on identifying occurring health trends, and the significance of health mapping to locate the occurring health disparities in the barangay and empowering communities. With a total of 170 health cases present in San Fermin, Cauayan City, Isabela as of November 2024. The researchers found that Purok 1 has 3 cases, Purok 2,19 cases, Purok 3, 11 cases, Purok 4, 8 cases, Purok 5, 12 cases, Purok 6, 19 cases, Purok 7, 13 cases, and Purok 8 having 85 cases.
These results have garnered feedback to the mapping system from the target respondents, consisting of barangay health officials and staff, with a mean of 4.57 and standard deviation of 0.278, corresponding to Strongly Agree to the Functionality of the system, a mean of 4.40 and standard deviation of  0.273, corresponding to Strongly Agree to the Usability of the system, a mean of 4.41 with a standard deviation of 0.275, corresponding to Strongly Agree to the Reliability of the system’s, a mean of 4.45 with a standard deviation of 0.343, corresponding  to Strongly Agree to the Security of the System and the data used, and a Grand Mean of 4.46 and standard deviation of 0.152, corresponding to Strongly Agree on the evaluation of the system from the users.
 Conclusions

5.3	Recommendations
Results of the study showed that the Health Mapping Technology using GIS is effective as tool for healthcare intervention, however, based on the limitations of the study, the researchers recommend using a wider range of data and parameters, which is applying to a larger area with more population and diversity, it is also recommended to cover more types of diseases, mainly contagious diseases, long-term diseases or health conditions, situational parameters and vulnerability, such as pregnancy, obesity and senior citizens to represent health mapping better. 	Gathering data on larger-scale health centers such as hospitals, which have more dense patient records for more data.  Adding more functions to the application to be able to explore more parameters such as vulnerability, and prediction of disease based on prospective data.
