approach give plants water plants use soil instead use water hydroponics science soilless gardening entails growing healthy plants without use traditional soil nutrient mineral rich water solution developing plant requires nutrients water sunlight plants grow without soil often grow better roots water purpose soil provide plants nutrients anchor roots still hydroponic garden youll provide plants complete fertilizer formula inert growing medium anchor roots give quicker access water nutrition dissolved water reaches roots quickly due sustainable approach resource utilization traditional growing methods hydroponic farming fast becoming popular alternative many farmers throughout world simple use make changes get positive impacts agriculture develop plants quickly harvested earlier light clean require cultural activities like plowing weeding soil fertilization crop rotation furthermore hydroponics practice growing plants without soil hydroponics commonly cultivates plants nutrientrich water although hydroponics also considered practice growing plants aggregates soil less barkbased mix hydroponics advantageous method gardening home commercial use weeds deal hydroponic plants typically healthy mature earlier use less space addition entirely waterbased possible automate hydroponics system fully gardener absent extended period plants suffer unlike traditional farming methods water typically reused much water lost evaporation runoff three different ways culturing hydroponicallygrown plants simplest one nutrient film technique uses plastic trough container holes

The major contributing factor in plagiarism is the availability of a high amount of data and information on the\n internet that can be swiftly accessed. The proposed system introduces an extrinsic plagiarism detection approach inspired by\n cognition because it utilizes semantic knowledge to detect the plagiarized part from the text without human involvement. A\n lexical database like WordNet assists the computers to perceive the data and information. These days most of the plagiarism\n detection systems fail to detect highly complex cases of plagiarism. The proposed system uses Dice measure as similarity\n measureforfindingthesemanticresemblancebetweenthepairofsentences.Italsouseslinguistic features like path similarity,\n depth estimation measure to computetheresemblancebetweenthepairofwordsandthesefeaturesarecombinedbyassigning\n different weights to them. It is capable of identifying cases like restructuring, paraphrasing, verbatim copy, and synonymized\n plagiarism. It has been evaluated on the PAN-PC-11 corpus. The results obtained from the proposed system signify that it\n has outperformed other existing systems on PAN-PC-11 in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and PlagDet score.
