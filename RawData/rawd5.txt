INTRODUCTION
Background of the Study 
Spatial data mining framework is a powerful tool that helps in unraveling the complex factors contributing to traffic congestion in urban areas. Leveraging the abundance of location-based data from diverse sources like smartphones, remote sensors, and sensor networks, this framework dives deep into geo-spatial data, which includes specific geographic positioning information like latitude and longitude. Traffic congestion in urban areas poses a multifaceted challenge, influenced by a myriad of factors such as vehicular mobility, road network properties, weather conditions, holidays, and peak hours (Zafar et al., 2022). This complex interplay requires innovative approaches that extend beyond conventional analyses. In recent years, the integration of spatial data mining techniques has emerged as a promising avenue for unraveling the intricate dynamics of traffic congestion in urban environments. As we embark on this research journey focused on Cauayan City, Isabela, preliminary findings underscore the significance of factors including vehicular mobility, road network properties, weather, holidays, and peak hours in contributing to traffic congestion. Understanding the spatial variations of these factors is crucial for devising targeted interventions that address the unique challenges posed by congestion in different zones within the city. This research seeks to delve deeper into these factors, exploring their nuanced relationships and evolving dynamics over time.  
	

Association Rule Mining serves as our guide in deciphering intricate relationships among variables within the dataset. It acts as a detective, revealing subtle connections that might elude conventional analyses. In the context of traffic congestion, this method illuminates associations between the identified factors and congestion patterns. These revelations empower us with actionable insights, guiding the formulation of targeted interventions. Complementing Association Rule Mining, Clustering Analysis adds a spatial lens to our exploration. It groups together similar data points, providing a holistic view of spatial patterns within the urban landscape. In the context of traffic congestion, Clustering Analysis identifies spatial clusters of congestion associated with variations in vehicular mobility, road network properties, weather, holidays, and peak hours. This nuanced understanding enhances our ability to address congestion challenges specific to different zones within the city. The synergy of Association Rule Mining and Clustering Analysis within our spatial data mining framework enhances the depth of our exploration. It enables us not only to identify associations among contributing factors but also to discern spatial patterns in congestion dynamics. This holistic approach holds promise for unraveling the multifaceted nature of traffic congestion, providing insights critical for informed urban planning and policy-making. 
Despite advancements in spatial data mining, a notable research gap persists in understanding how the identified factors and spatial patterns dynamically evolve over time. This study aims to bridge this gap by incorporating a temporal dimension, enriching our comprehension of traffic congestion in urban areas. As we navigate through the subsequent chapters, our focus is on evaluating the effectiveness of these techniques in the specific context of Cauayan City, Isabela, while also contributing to the broader understanding of the temporal dynamics influencing traffic congestion.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS 
2.1 Review of Related Literature
Based on the study “Using Spatial Data Mining Framework for Identifying the Significance of Factors Contributing to Traffic Congestion in Urban Areas.” The following references are relevant and appropriate for the review: 
Spatial Data Mining in Traffic Analysis 
Traffic congestion is a complex issue influenced by various factors. Studies have shown that urban mobility, road capacity, and daily traffic significantly contribute to traffic congestion (Suryani et al., 2020). 
  Additionally, the demand for traffic at different times of the day, road narrowing, traffic density, and traffic lights are identified as contributing factors to congestion ("An IoT Based Intelligent Traffic Management System and Its Implementation on Cupcarbon for Smart Cities", 2021; Yusuf et al., 2021).  
 Furthermore, the impact of weather conditions, spatial and temporal factors, and the growth of population and vehicles have been recognized as significant contributors to traffic congestion (Hussain et al., 2022; Dammulla, 2022; Ogunyemi et al., 2021). The increase in the number of vehicles, road accidents, and the desire for vehicle ownership have also been identified as causes of traffic congestion (Hilmani et al., 2020; Al-Asadi et al., 2022). 
In review paper of Cheng et al. (2018) emphasized the significance of multi-view learning for short-term traffic forecasting, considering spatial correlation, heterogeneity, temporal fluctuation, and regularity in road traffic. This approach offers a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic and data-intensive nature of traffic-related data mining. 
Mihai (2021) discussed the collective use of spatial data mining techniques with GIS and satellite imagery in various domains, such as traffic risk analysis, fire accident analysis, and urban planning. This illustrates the broad range of applications where spatial data mining plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful insights. 
In relation to Chen et al. (2021) and Cheng et al. (2023) focused on integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into traffic flow forecasting models to effectively capture spatial-temporal dependencies. This approach has demonstrated promising results in uncovering the complex 
relationships within traffic flow data. 
Meanwhile Liu et al. (2021) highlighted spatial-temporal patterns in traffic queues, indicating the potential for mining interesting patterns in traffic-related spatial data. Understanding these patterns is essential for efficient traffic management and optimization. 
In papers of Zhang et al. (2021) and Zheng et al. (2018) discussed the utilization of spatial data mining techniques for analyzing urban traffic structures and probe-car tracking data, respectively. These studies emphasize the importance of spatial data mining in enhancing traffic analysis and management systems. 
In the case of the Philippines, where intercity bus transportation is widely used due to the current lack of a railway network, city traffic, especially in Manila, is heavily congested, partly due to a high number of city buses running half-empty, the small proportion of road space relative to the vehicle population, and the insufficient provision of urban rail transportation.” (Boquet, 2019) 
  Moreover, the influence of public transport, land use patterns, and the pattern of heavy vehicles on the road have been studied as factors contributing to congestion (Yap et al., 2022; Droj et al., 2021; Kesuma et al., 2019). Furthermore, the impact of autonomous and connected vehicles on traffic congestion has been investigated, indicating their potential influence on traffic flow (Wu et al., 2022; Kunibe et al., 2021). 
One key aspect that has been investigated is the analysis of traffic congestion and transportation policies in Metro Manila. Sidel (2020) conducted a comprehensive analysis treating traffic in Metro Manila as an ecosystem, highlighting the complex interplay of demographic, economic, and technological factors contributing to gridlock in the region. This systemic approach is essential for understanding the root causes of traffic issues in urban areas. 
Moreover, studies such as Ugalino (2024) have focused on spatiotemporal analysis of traffic accidents hotspots, emphasizing the importance of data-driven approaches to identify high-risk areas and improve road safety measures. By utilizing Twitter data, insights into traffic accident patterns in cities like Quezon City have been uncovered, shedding light on areas that require targeted interventions.
Additionally, the impact of traffic on various stakeholders, such as traffic enforcers, has been examined. Gumasing et al. (2023) investigated the ergonomic risk factors affecting traffic enforcers in Manila City, emphasizing the importance of addressing environmental and postural risk factors to mitigate musculoskeletal disorders among this group. 
In addition to safety concerns, studies like Rito et al. (2021) have explored the modeling of traffic flow, energy use, and emissions in major thoroughfares like EDSA in the Philippines. By leveraging tools like Google Maps and Google Street View, researchers have been able to assess traffic characteristics and environmental impacts, paving the way for more sustainable transportation practices. 
Forecasting road traffic accidents has also been a focus of research in the Philippines. 
Sabenorio et al. (2023) conducted a study on forecasting road traffic accidents in Metro Manila using ARIMA modeling, providing valuable insights into trends and patterns that can inform proactive safety measures and policy interventions. 
Datamining Frameworks in Traffic Analysis 
Apriori - Association rule mining 
The Apriori algorithm, a popular data mining algorithm, has been utilized in various studies to identify significant factors contributing to different phenomena (Yu et al., 2019). applied the Apriori algorithm to mine significant association rules between the severity of crash accidents and the factors influencing their occurrence. 
 Similarly, Cai (2020) highlighted the use of the Apriori algorithm in analyzing traffic accidents on urban roads. Furthermore, Si et al. (2022) emphasized the significant contribution of traffic congestion to climate change through the emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) such as Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), and Ozone (O3). 
Abstract Motivated by traffic congestion and air pollution, Beijing is one of several major cities to restrict vehicle ownership by requiring residents to win a lottery for the right to obtain an additional car.” (Qin et al., 2023) 
With this workflow we create a dataset named Seattle Area Traffic Congestion Status (SATCS) based on traffic congestion map snapshots from a publicly available online traffic service provider Washington State Department of Transportation.” (Zhang et al., 2019) 
The key workers are staying out the bus routes with higher frequency of passenger boarding to avoid the COVID-19 transmission but other people were unable to avoid these busy routes because of poor accessibility to essential goods and services.” (Amin & Adah, 2022) 
 Additionally, González et al. (2021) conducted an analysis using big data, which revealed a positive non-linear causality of congestion on the number of accidents, further emphasizing the impact of traffic congestion on accidents. 
Apriori - Association rule mining has been extensively utilized in various fields, including traffic analysis. The Apriori algorithm, a classic association rule mining technique, has been applied to identify factors influencing traffic-related incidents. Researchers have enhanced this algorithm to delve into the causes of traffic accidents on urban roads (Cai, 2020). By improving the Apriori algorithm, researchers have been able to mine association rules between risk factors, providing insights into the complex interactions leading to accidents (Cai, 2020). Moreover, the algorithm has been adapted to consider directional constraints and index weights in the context of traffic crash data analysis, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to accidents (Yang et al., 2022). 
In the realm of traffic safety research, the Apriori algorithm has proven to be a valuable tool for analyzing traffic violation data and identifying patterns related to accidents (Yang et al., 2023). It has been instrumental in discovering the relationship between various parameters of road accidents, highlighting its significance in uncovering correlations in different aspects of road safety (Tariq et al., 2022). Additionally, the algorithm has been employed to identify aggressive driving behavior and patterns of pedestrian crashes, further showcasing its versatility in analyzing diverse traffic-related data (Wu, 2023). 
Furthermore, the Apriori algorithm has been used to examine factors associated with different types of accidents, such as motor and non-motor vehicle accidents during day and night, emphasizing its applicability in understanding the nuances of traffic incidents (CHEN, 2024). Researchers have also utilized association rule mining to explore the environmental, vehicle, and driver factors contributing to specific types of crashes, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in uncovering multifaceted relationships within traffic data (Yang et al., 2020). 
K-means Clustering 
To identify significant factors contributing to traffic congestion, several studies have utilized the K-means clustering algorithm. Ghaffari et al. (2022) employed K-means clustering to find an optimal path in smart cities by considering traffic congestion and air pollution. Jiang et al. (2020) utilized K-means to cluster traffic states based on road congestion, safety, and stability indicators.  
Additionally, Wang et al. (2020) highlighted the widespread use of the K-means algorithm in solving traffic clustering problems. These studies demonstrate the relevance of K-means clustering in analyzing traffic congestion.  
Furthermore, factors contributing to traffic congestion were explored in various studies. Hamza et al. (2023) associated traffic congestion with increased environmental pollution and reduced socio-economic productivity due to significant travel time delays. Additionally, Priambodo et al. (2020) used K-means clustering to analyze traffic flow conditions and identify traffic states, indicating the relevance of K-means in understanding the factors influencing congestion.  
The criteria include air traffic flow, airspace operational performance, flight procedure quality, cost, controller workload and pilot workload.” (Liang et al., 2022) 
Moreover, the impact of traffic congestion on various aspects was investigated. Zamri & Hamzah (2022) determined the factors contributing to traffic congestion and assessed its impact on road users, society, and the economy. Additionally, Suryani et al. (2020) highlighted urban mobility, daily traffic, and road capacity as factors affecting traffic congestion. 
K-means clustering is a commonly used technique in traffic analysis for identifying various factors related to traffic conditions. Xia and Chen Saha et al. (2019) utilized K-means clustering to identify traffic flow phases based on traffic density and speed data. Azimi and Zhang Lu et al. (2023) compared different clustering algorithms and found that K-means performed best in identifying traffic states based on flow characteristics. Gao et al. (2023) proposed a method for traffic state recognition using K-means clustering and AdaBoost-DS, achieving high accuracy in recognizing traffic conditions. Additionally, Ghaffari et al. (2022) and Khan et al. (2022) also employed K-means clustering for traffic congestion analysis and 5G network planning, respectively. 
Furthermore, K-means clustering has been applied in various traffic-related applications. Lei et al. (2022) discussed the use of K-means clustering for maritime traffic pattern analysis, emphasizing its effectiveness in clustering ship trajectories. Shen et al. (2020) used the K-means algorithm for grouping traffic flows to determine traffic conditions, aiding in selecting appropriate traffic signal control schemes. Moreover, K-means clustering has been instrumental in traffic safety research, as demonstrated by (Chen et al., 2020), who used it for road traffic accident classification. 
The literature also demonstrates the versatility of K-means clustering in traffic-related studies. Wang et al. (2020) highlighted the widespread use of the K-means algorithm in traffic clustering tasks. Thimmisetty (2021) compared K-means with other clustering methods, showing its superiority in learning high-purity clusters for traffic analysis. Additionally, Bao (2019) identified traffic flow states using K-means clustering, emphasizing the importance of density in traffic flow state identification. 
Integration of both Apriori and K-means 
To identify significant factors contributing to traffic congestion, recent studies have utilized advanced algorithms such as K-means clustering and Apriori. Ghaffari et al. (2022) applied the Kmeans clustering algorithm to identify optimal path-finding in smart cities, considering traffic congestion. Similarly, Jiang et al. (2020) utilized K-means to cluster traffic states based on indicators of road congestion, safety, and stability. These studies demonstrate the relevance of K-means in understanding and addressing traffic congestion. In addition to K-means, Xie et al. (2020) employed the Apriori algorithm to capture dynamic associations of regional traffic congestion, indicating its effectiveness in excavating underlying traffic congestion associations.  
Furthermore, Han et al. (2020) used an Apriori-based method to mine temporal association rule patterns for predicting traffic congestion, yielding satisfactory results. These studies highlight the utility of Apriori in uncovering complex associations related to traffic congestion. Moreover, Mostafi et al. (2022) developed RegTraffic, a regression-based traffic simulator that effectively predicts traffic congestion, showcasing the potential of regression-based approaches in modeling and simulating traffic congestion. 
Additionally, Tsuboi (2021) focused on a traffic congestion model in India using the Shock Wave Theory, emphasizing the macro view of traffic congestion, which is crucial for understanding its broader impact. These recent studies demonstrate the significance of K-means clustering and Apriori in identifying and understanding factors contributing to traffic congestion.  
By leveraging these advanced algorithms, researchers have made strides in uncovering dynamic associations, clustering traffic states, and predicting congestion patterns, ultimately contributing to the development of effective strategies for mitigating traffic congestion.

5 SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
5.1 Summary 
The transportation network is well-developed with a mix of lane counts and road types, with 2-lane roads being the largest. Traffic conditions are free flow, heavy, and moderate. Wind speed and humidity frequencies are bell-shaped, with Monday being the most frequent weekday. Summary statistics provide insights into central tendencies and variability. 
5.2 Conclusions 
The study utilized a spatial data mining framework to identify the significance of factors contributing to traffic congestion in Cauayan City, a specific urban area. The analysis incorporated traffic flow data and land use data as inputs and employed spatial clustering and association rule mining techniques. The results of the study provided valuable insights into the factors contributing to traffic congestion in Cauayan City. By analyzing the traffic flow data, the study identified patterns and trends in the volume and movement of vehicles, offering a quantitative understanding of congestion within the city. Through the spatial clustering analysis, the study identified clusters or groups of locations with similar traffic congestion characteristics. This allowed for the identification of specific areas within Cauayan City that experience higher levels of congestion, providing a spatial perspective on the issue. Furthermore, the association rule mining analysis revealed significant associations and relationships between different factors and traffic congestion in Cauayan City. This helped in understanding the interdependencies and influences of various variables, such as road capacity, traffic incidents, weather conditions, time of day, and urbanization, on congestion within the city.
