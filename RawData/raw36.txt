Abstract
Millions of tons of agricultural waste are generated annually. The disposal and management of these wastes remain a source of legitimate concerns for environmentalists, governments, and other stakeholders. Inappropriate disposal and management of these wastes constitute an environmental eyesore, health hazards, and source of contamination for aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Conversion of agricultural wastes into useful products remains a cost-effective, eco-friendly, and sustainable strategy for waste management. This study reviews various pretreatment practices aimed at improving the biodegradability and digestibility of agricultural lignocellulosic biomass. The common pretreatment techniques such as physical, chemical, biological, and physicochemical as well as the novel green solvent-based pretreatment are reviewed and emphasized to improve their practicability and applicability. This review encompasses the processes, benefits, and drawbacks of the various pretreatment techniques to further enrich literature and stimulate renewed investigations in the research space. The outcome of this study will stimulate further investment in agricultural waste conversion and utilization. Waste conversion is a feasible waste management strategy for a clean environment and sustainable ecosystem. Going forward, more targeted investigations are needed to evolve innovative techniques to simplify the conversion of agricultural wastes into valuable products. Governments, across jurisdictions, environmentalists, policymakers, and other stakeholders should sensitize citizens to dislodge the religious and cultural barriers against waste conversion.

1. Introduction
Increased population growth, accelerated urbanization, industrialization, and environmental degradation have continued to pose legitimate concerns to humanity on a scale never imagined despite sustained efforts by relevant bodies. These situations have given rise to challenges that have continued to engage the attention of individuals, groups, countries, and international organizations. Poverty, environmental degradation, energy insecurity, unavailability of safe water and sanitation, gender inequality, and lack of peaceful coexistence have continued to plague the global population. Inappropriate waste disposal and management are closely connected to sanitation, healthy living, air quality, climate change, food and resource security, and environmental sustainability [1]. Both developed and developing countries are enacting policies and allocating huge resources to confront the pervasive issue of ever-increasing waste generation and disposal. The problem of waste management is being exacerbated by rapid population growth, urbanization, consumer shopping habits, improved economic and industrial activities, and an increased rate of food production and consumption [2,3]. For example, the global waste generation was about 2.02 billion tons in 2016 and has been estimated to become 2.59 billion tons in 2030 and 3.4 billion tons in 2050 [4] (Fig. 1). The global waste management market value has been estimated to increase from USD 1.61 trillion in 2020 to USD 2.5 trillion in 2030 [5]. Managing these huge wastes has been a herculean task for humanity.

Inappropriate disposal and management of agricultural wastes negatively impact the environment and constitute a nuisance to environmental sanitation. Enforcement of policies and laws that encourage waste reduction, reutilization, recycling, and regeneration that can ultimately gravitate the production sector towards zero waste is required [6,7]. New laws and innovative waste management strategies that encourage waste recycling and conversion to useable resources are needed. Agriculture wastes, when optimally managed and utilized, have the potential to become a sustainable resource for value addition and a major contributor to energy security and ecological sustainability. Conversion and appropriate utilization of agricultural wastes can engender economic development, conservation of resources, contribute to the circular economy, and fortification of human health [8,9].
The subject of waste conversion and utilization is not new. There have been various studies conducted to unearth the various applications of waste. In earlier research, Taghizadeh-Alisaraei et al. [10] conducted a detailed feasibility study on the conversion of citrus fruit waste. Similarly, Awogbemi et al. [1] recently surveyed various strategies of waste management to ensure waste minimization, waste conversion, and utilization. Shen et al. [11], Ge et al. [12], and Atanda et al. [13] highlighted various pathways for the conversion of agricultural wastes into useful products. They agreed on the multifaceted application of agricultural wastes to our daily life and industrial development. The work of Awasthi et al. [14] x-rayed the contributions of agricultural wastes to bioeconomy and a green future. Specifically, Kanwal et al. [15], Akhter et al. [16], and Ismail and Mohamad [17] investigated various processes for converting sugarcane bagasse, rice husk, and rice straw respectively into useful products. These authors agreed on the feasibility and the benefits derivable from the conversion of various wastes for various applications. They are however on the need to pretreat agricultural waste before its conversion. In furtherance of this result, Ndayisenga et al. [18], Naik et al. [19], and Hoang et al. [20] investigated pretreatment techniques applicable to agricultural wastes.
Despite the outcomes of the aforementioned research, it is pertinent to ask whether the subject of pretreatment techniques for agricultural wastes before conversion into various products has been fully explored. The motivation for the current intervention is to further interrogate the various techniques and technologies for the treatment of agricultural wastes to ease their conversion into various products. This study aims to carry out an up-to-date review of methods and processes carried out on agricultural wastes before their conversion. The scope of the current study is limited to a review of relevant recent literature on the pretreatment techniques applied to agricultural wastes. The current study entails the lignocellulosic composition of various agricultural wastes, types, benefits, and drawbacks of the various pretreatment techniques, conclusion, and future perspectives. The outcome of this investigation will enrich scholarship by providing updated information on the various pretreatment methods for agricultural wastes. Exercise will bring to the fore novel technologies for the transformation of various agricultural wastes into renewable biofuels to stimulate further research in the subject area. The research will further provoke further research on the effectiveness of waste conversion as a waste management strategy. Farm owners, environmentalists, policymakers, small-scale entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders will find the outcome of this study useful in their various fields.
2. Lignocellulosic composition of agricultural wastes
Agricultural wastes are usually lignocellulosic biomass which contains complex molecular structures including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, as shown in Fig. 2 [21]. In addition to these components, lignocellulosic biomass also contains some extractives such as ash and protein, though in very small quantities. Since the ash and proteins are in negligible amounts, their presence is of no effect on the composition, pretreatment, and conversion of lignocellulosic biomass. The complex compact matrices are broken into simple monomers before they are converted into various forms [21,22]. Generally, agricultural wastes consist more of cellulose than hemicellulose and lignin.

Cellulose is the most abundant natural linear carbohydrate polymer containing D-glucose and is regarded as the cell wall of the plant. Cellulose can also be described as a polysaccharide of anhydrous-glucopyranose with distinctive mechanical potency and chemical stability [23]. The chemical formula of cellulose is C6H10O5 [24]. Hemicellulose (C5H4O8) encloses the cellulose fibers and connects cellulose and lignin. It is made up of diverse assemblage of branched polysaccharides. Structurally, hemicellulose consists of monomers including glucose, galactose, mannose, xylose, arabinose, and glucuronic acid. Hemicellulose is amorphous, easily hydrolyzed by weak acids, bases, and enzymes, and less resistant to chemicals. When compared with cellulose, hemicellulose possesses less physical strength [25].
Lignin is a non-carbohydrate complex aromatic polymer congregated by unevenly positioned phenylpropane units for structural rigidity [23]. It is fastened to cellulose and hemicellulose and helps to infuse strength and solidity to the material cell wall. It also forms an impenetrable wall that is resistant to water and physical and chemical resistance to microbial attack. Lignin is aquaphobic and cannot dissolve in water [25,26]. The general formula for lignin is C9H10O3(OCH3)0.9-1.7) and it consists of guaiacyl, syringyl, p-hydroxy phenol, and other macromolecules [24]. Generally, a typical agricultural waste contains about 35–50% cellulose, 20–35% hemicellulose, and 15–20% lignin. Table 1 is a compilation of the lignocellulosic composition of some agricultural wastes.

Comparatively, cellulose could be fermented to generate high-prized chemicals and fuels by hydrolysis. Hemicellulose is less crystalline than cellulose but is also used to manufacture industrial chemicals and other value-added products. Lignin can generate special industrial chemicals. The digestibility of lignocellulosic material is a function of its biomass content. Materials with high lignin content have low digestibility and high hydraulic retention time while those rich in sugar have high digestibility and low hydraulic retention time (Fig. 3) [24,38].

3. Pretreatment methods for agricultural wastes
Due to their compositional makeup and complex physicochemical structure, some lignocellulosic biomass, including agricultural wastes are not easily degraded. To overcome this hurdle, the biomass is subjected to some processes. Pretreatment processes are the operations carried out on the biomass to overcome the initial resistance to its easy conversion. These operations alter the constituents of the biomass thereby increasing the conversion efficiency. During the process, the complex molecules in the biomass are broken into cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The decomposition of cellulose is to enhance the porosity and the surface area while reducing the crystallinity of the cellulosic moiety. The main purpose for carrying out pretreatment of agricultural wastes and other lignocellulosic biomass include reduction of energy consumption during conversion, cost reduction, and direct formation of sugars from the biomass. The pretreatment practice also ensures the preservation of the sugar produced from degradation as well as the reduction in the production of inhibitory products [39,40]. The common pretreatment approaches include physical, chemical, biological, physicochemical, and green solvent-based process. Table 2 compiles the benefits and drawbacks of various types of biomass pretreatment methods.

3.1. Physical pretreatment
Physical pretreatment techniques are used to achieve a reduction in particle size and improved surface area of the agricultural wastes. The size reduction ensures increased enzyme and microbe accessibility during processing, reduction in the crystallinity of cellulose, increased conversion efficiency, and ultimately better product yield. The physical pretreatment method also includes mechanical pretreatment, ultrasonic pretreatment, microwave pretreatment, and thermal pretreatment processes.
Mechanical pretreatment exerts mechanical force to break the hard structure of lignocellulose to reduce the particle size, lignin content, and degree of polymerization. It also ensures improved access of the chemicals or enzymes to the cellulose and hemicellulose and increases the surface area for a better reaction. Mechanical pretreatment is achieved by cutting, milling, chipping, shearing, and stirring [41,42]. Ultrasonic pretreatment involves the generation of high-energy vibrations that penetrates and decomposes the crystals of the lignocellulose structure. The high frequency, intensity, and duration of ultrasonic vibrations have been used to remove 80–100% lignin content from coffee waste, cabbage, and peanut [43,44].
Thermal pretreatment is the application of high temperature to dissolve xylan, araban, and mannan contained in the lignocellulose [45]. This allows the enzymes and other chemicals to gain more access into cellulose and hemicellulose. Morales et al. [46] and Ahorsu et al. [47] report that subjecting agricultural wastes to hydrothermal pretreatment at 200 °C for 90 min helps to dissolve oligomers, extract lignin, and raise conversion efficiency to 96.4%. Microwave pretreatment generates electromagnetic radiation that percolates the fabric of the agricultural wastes to weaken the forces holding the different components together [48].
3.2. Chemical pretreatment
Chemical pretreatments involve the deployment of special chemicals to overcome and dissolve the rigid lignocellulose crystal structure. Acids, alkalis, oxidation, and organic solvent have been used as chemicals to enlarge the surface area and enhance the biodegradability of agricultural wastes [49].
3.2.1. Acid pretreatment
Acids such as HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4, HNO3, Na2CO3, CH3COOH, CH2O2, C4H4O4, etc. have been used as reagents to degrade the glycosidic bonds in lignocellulose, breakdown the cellulose and hemicellulose thereby promoting the release of fermentable sugar. However, only a diluted version of these acids is recommended to minimize the risk of toxicity, corrosion, and handling [50]. An earlier investigation by Ruan et al. [51] and Gonzales et al. [52] revealed that pretreating eucalyptus chips, empty palm fruit bunch, rice husks, and wood pellets with diluted H3PO4 and H2SO4 results in total sugar recovery efficiency of up to 60%.
3.2.2. Alkali pretreatment
Alkaline pretreatment is the application of alkaline reagents to liquefy lignin and a portion of hemicellulose to decrease the cellulose crystallinity, thereby promoting the conversion of the biomass. Alkaline reagents such as NaOH, KOH, NH4OH, NH3·H2O, Ca(OH)2, etc. have been used to pretreat lignocellulose and increase the conversion yield. Though alkaline pretreatment is cost-effective and reduces environmental pollution, the need for a long reaction duration and neutralization of the pretreated slurry are some of the obvious drawbacks [53]. The application of NaOH and Na2CO3 to pretreat wheat straw increased the solid dissolution efficiency to 86.7% and 91.1%, respectively [54].
3.2.3. Oxidative pretreatment
Oxidative pretreatment capitalizes on the oxidating property of ozone gas and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to decompose the lignin and hemicellulose in the biomass to facilitate the release of soluble compounds. The H2O2 chemically decomposed into –OH and O2− and assist in the destruction of the structure of lignin while preventing the release of any inhibitory by-products [55,56]. Dos Santos et al. [57] confirmed the effectiveness of ozone to serve as effective lignin removal from coffee husks for improved biogas production while Yuan et al. [58] successfully deployed H2O2 to reduce lignin content by about 63%.
3.2.4. Organic solvent pretreatment
Organosolv pretreatment is the application of some organic solvents to break the internal bonds of lignin and hemicelluloses for the decomposition of lignocellulosic material to ensure effective cellulose conversion. Frequently applied organic solvents include methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuranol, ethylene glycol, and acetone [43]. In some cases, acids such as HCl and H2SO4 or bases like NaOH, NH3, and CaCO3 are used as catalysts to speed up the reaction process [25]. In a study, Salapa et al. [59] demonstrated that treating wheat straw with acetone resulted in lignin removal efficiency of about 76%. Similarly, Tang et al. [60] reported an 81.7% lignin removal efficiency when corn stover was treated with acetone.
3.3. Biological pretreatment
Biological pretreatment is the application of aerobic bacteria, enzymes, or fungi for the degradation of lignin thereby promoting easy conversion of the lignocellulose material to utilizable products. This method of pretreatment is ecologically benign, discharges no poisonous substance to the environment, consumes little energy, and produces little or no inhibitor [61]. However, the biological pretreatment process is slow, and time-consuming resulting in huge residence time. There is also the likelihood of microbial instability leading to unpredictable reaction outcomes [62].
3.3.1. Fungal pretreatment
Fungal pretreatment is a form of biological pretreatment method where white-rot fungi, brown rot fungi, soft rot fungi, and other fungi are deployed to degrade lignin. In many cases, white-rot fungi belonging to the class Basidiomycetes Phanerochaete chrysosporium are used for lignin biodegradation. In a recent study, Ma et al. [63] utilized white-rot fungus Peniophora incarnata for the pretreatment of waste wood which resulted in the reduction of the composition of hemicellulose and lignin by 48% and 70%, respectively. Unlike the physical and chemical pretreatment methods, fungal pretreatment does not require the use of any machine or chemicals. The efficiency of the fungal pretreatment is determined by water content and particle size of the feedstock, reaction temperature, and residence time.
3.3.2. Termites
Termites are also used as organisms to decompose lignocellulose materials. Termites belong to the class of microorganisms that have the capacity to secrete enzymes to degrade lignocellulose. Several class of termites such as Microcerotermes parvus, Termes hospes, and Nasutitermes ephratae were reported to secrete lignocellulose degrading enzymes for the degradation of wheat straw, preparatory to its anaerobic digestion [64].
3.3.3. Microbial consortium pretreatment
In the Microbial consortium pretreatment method, microbes from soil, wastewater, broiler droppings, etc. are used as pretreatment agents for agricultural wastes. The microbes possess the ability to decompose both the cellulose and hemicellulose in agricultural wastes. In a research, microbes sourced from landfills, decomposing straws, and wastewater were used to pretreat cassava wastes leading to 96% biogas yield [65].
3.3.4. Enzymes
Enzymes such as cellulases and hemicellulases are capable of pretreating agricultural wastes and other lignocellulosic biomass. Agricultural wastes such as cassava pulp, sugarcane bagasse, corn stover, Napier grass, rice straw, etc. have been pretreated with enzymes to enhance their conversion efficiency for biobutanol production [[66], [67], [68]]. Bacterial pretreatment involves the use of enzymes-producing bacteria to slow down the polymerization of lignocellulose. Chen et al. [69] effectively utilized the cellulolytic bacterium Acetobacter Orientalis to achieve about 76.24% cellulose degradation efficiency of banana residue. Similarly, Xu, et al. [70] treated corn stalks with Bacillus Subtilis to ensure lignin decomposition and decrease cellulose crystallinity.
3.4. Physicochemical pretreatment
Physicochemical pretreatment methods combine the beneficial features of both the physical and chemical pretreatments for maximum lignin denigration and cellulose crystallinity reduction efficiency. They help to reduce the lignin and hemicellulose contents and enhance the synthesis of fermentable sugar. Common examples of physicochemical pretreatment include steam explosion, alkali-heat pretreatment, ammonia fiber expansion, and extrusion method.
3.4.1. Steam explosion pretreatment
The steam explosion pretreatment method entails the separation of cellulose from lignocellulose by fracturing the β-O-4 bond in the lignin and annihilating the cell wall configuration of biomass under strict reaction temperature and pressure conditions. Recent investigations have shown that the method performs optimally at a pressure range of 0.5–5 MPa and temperatures of 160–250 °C, in most cases [49,71,72]. Tanpichai et al. [73] reported 80% lignin removal when pineapple leaf fibers were pretreated by the steam explosion in moderate reaction conditions of 215 °C, 2 MPa for 5 min. Similarly, a 90% reduction in lignin and 64–81% increment in cellulose content were accomplished when the reed was subjected to steam explosion pretreatment at 200 °C, 3.4 MPa for about 15 min, before anaerobic digestion [74]. Notwithstanding these positive results, the steam explosion pretreatment method is plagued with high energy consumption, and generation of inhibitory compounds, and requires harsh reaction conditions [55,75].
3.4.2. Alkali-heat pretreatment
Alkali-heat pretreatment combines the use of alkali and high temperature to decompose lignin, lower the crystallinity of lignocellulose, and increase the contact surface area of cellulose. Alkali such as NaOH, NaCO3, and alkaline peroxide is preheated to temperatures between 75 and 125 °C for simultaneous lignin and hemicellulose removal and increment in cellulose content [76]. Zhang et al. [77] and Lopez et al. [78], in their separate investigations, reported lignin and hemicellulose removal efficiency of between 54.09% and 67.67% and a corresponding 51.65% increment in cellulose content when corn straw was subjected to NaOH-heat pretreatment at 170 °C. The complexity of this process and the high cost of maintaining the high temperature required for the pretreatment are the major drawbacks of wide application of the method [71].
3.4.3. Ammonia fiber explosion pretreatment
Ammonia fiber explosion was developed as a panacea to the deficiencies associated with the alkali-heat pretreatment method. Under this method, ammonia and oxyhydrogen ions are synthesized from liquid ammonia, at high pressure, thus causing a sudden temperature rise. This leads to decomposition of the ester and ether bonds between lignin and hemicellulose and subsequent reduction in the cellulose crystals [79]. This method has been highly effective in the degradation of lignin and improved glucose yield of barley straw [80] and corn stover [43]. Presoaking of feedstocks in hydrogen peroxide before ammonia fiber explosion pretreatment substantially increases glucose and sugar yields when pretreating some energy crops [81].
3.4.4. Extrusion pretreatment
Extrusion pretreatment is the amalgamation of thermal and mechanical pretreatment methods to alter the physical and chemical makeup of lignocellulose. During this process, force is exerted on the agricultural wastes in an airtight vessel to elevate the temperature and pressure. This causes an alteration in the physical and chemical structures of the lignocellulosic material. The addition of NaOH to the extrusion process results in improved removal efficiency of hemicellulose and lignin [82,83]. Further studies revealed that the amalgamated impacts of extrusion and heat-moisture pretreatment alter the composition and morphologic structure of corn straw resulting in a 421% increment in sugar yield [83].
3.5. Green solvent-based pretreatment methods
Advancements in research and the development of innovative technologies have led to the discovery of other environmentally friendly pretreatment methods. Notable emerging green solvent-based pretreatment methods include biochemical pretreatment, ionic liquid pretreatment, deep eutectic solvent pretreatment, and supercritical fluid pretreatment.
3.5.1. Biochemical pretreatment
Biochemical pretreatment methods were developed to compensate for the low efficiency and long residence time associated with biological pretreatment and the huge volume of a variety of chemicals and the synthesis of inhibitory compounds during the chemical pretreatment process [84]. Yadav and Vivekanand [85] and Kumar et al. [71] confirmed that the application of white-rot fungus Abortiporus biennis to treat wheat straw before KOH and NaOH pretreatment elevated lignin degradability by 19% and 31%, respectively, compared with when the white-rot fungus was not used. Another study by Shen et al. [86] confirmed the treatment of rice straw with Sphingobacterium sp. LD-1 before NaOH treatment obliterated the intermolecular force and internal hydrogen bond by 60% and 32% respectively but increased the cellulose content by 41%. Other recent studies have shown that the addition of biological and chemical pretreatments not only improves lignin degradability, and offers techno-economic advantages but also contributes to substantially enhance the overall conversion efficiency of biomass [87].
3.5.2. Ionic liquid pretreatment
Ionic liquids are molten salts or liquid electrolytes. They are made up of cation (imidazole, pyridine, choline) and ions (chloride and acetate) and are liquid at or below room temperature [88]. When they interact with lignocellulose materials, the β-O-4 bonds are broken, and ion-dipole bonds are formed in lignin. This results in the interruption of the crystalline composite makeup of lignocellulose, decomposition of the lignin structure, and subsequent separation of lignin and hemicellulose from the cellulose-rich materials [89,90]. Yang et al. [91] showed the addition of Tween-80 and [Emim]OAc to bagasse boosted the enzymatic hydrolysis rate of microcrystalline cellulose by more than 250% and raised the conversion rate by 45%. Ionic liquids are renewable alternatives to organic solvents, easy to synthesize, highly recoverable and recyclable, do not produce any toxic chemicals, and are preferred above other nonrenewable solvents [92].
3.5.3. Deep eutectic solvents
Deep eutectic solvents are similar to and referred to as a novel version of ionic liquids in physical and chemical properties and an eco-friendly alternative to ionic liquids. Deep eutectic solvents comprise of hydrogen bond donor (urea, amides, alcohols, acids, etc.) and hydrogen bond acceptor (choline chloride, betaine, alanine, etc.) [93,94]. The interface between hydrogen bond donor and acceptor creates a slight acid or base catalytic blend to degrade the ether bond between lignin and hemicellulose during lignocellulose pretreatment. Ma et al. [93] reported a 96% lignin removal efficiency when poplar wood was pretreated with deep eutectic solvents such as choline chloride–ethylene glycol. Similarly, the combination of hydrothermal and deep eutectic solvents such as choline chloride-lactic acid to pretreat moso bamboo resulted in lignin and hemicellulose degradation efficiency of 86.9% and 98.2%, respectively, while retaining the structure and composition of cellulose [95]. The process promotes biomass valorization and supports the bioconversion of cellulose.
3.5.4. Supercritical fluid
Supercritical fluids (H2O, CO2) are fluid that behaves like liquids at above critical temperature (304.25 k) and pressure (7.36 MPa). They are cheap, safe, low-cost, non-poisonous, non-combustible, ecological benign friendly, and renewable properties. Dissolving lignocellulose in a supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) solution causes the alteration of structure and decomposition of the chemical bonds between lignin and hemicellulose [88]. Pretreatment of green coconut fiber with SCCO2 at 20–30 MPa for 6–72 h increased the sugar production efficiency to 101%. The application of SCCO2 and supercritical steam explosion in the pretreatment of microalgal and lignocellulosic biomass leads to a substantial increase in the generation of reducing sugar [56,82]. In another research, Zhang et al. [96] established how the pretreatment of sorghum stalk with SCCO2 and ultrasonic vibration altered the microscopic structures of the feedstock and increased simple sugar yield by 34.5% during enzymatic hydrolysis conversion.
4. Conclusion and future perspectives
The menace constituted by the huge volume of agricultural wastes generated by various activities across the world can be minimized by evolving effective waste management strategies. Waste minimization, waste reduction, waste utilization, and waste conversion are some of the techniques adopted to safeguard humanity from the impacts of these wastes. Waste conversion remains one of the feasible, eco-friendly, and sustainable options available for deriving maximum benefits from crop residues and other wastes from agricultural activities. However, by the composition of agricultural wastes, their conversion into useful products is plagued with challenges that hinders the ease of conversion, precipitates poor conversion efficiency, and retards the conversion processes. To overcome these challenges, the wastes must be subjected to an appropriate pretreatment technique to improve their conversion rate, enhance their biodegradation and digestibility, reduce process energy consumption, and increase the volume of the products generated.
This study reviews cost-effective, practicable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly strategies for improving the biodegradability and digestibility of crop residues, agricultural waste, and other lignocellulosic biomass. The processes are classified broadly as physical, chemical, biological, physicochemical, and other innovative green solvent-based pretreatment techniques. The five broad pretreatment techniques are further broken down into subdivisions to aid a better understanding of the processes. The processes, merits, drawbacks, and major points of these techniques are compiled from relevant published research outcomes and highlighted. Though the pretreatment inflicts additional cost, infrastructural requirements, manpower demands, and energy consumption on the entire production process, the benefits derivable from the process make the process inevitable. The pretreatment process helps to improve the biodegradability, digestibility, and ease of conversion of the lignocellulosic biomass by reducing the energy required to separate the cellulose, hemicellulose, and the lignin contents of the biomass.
Going forward, novel pretreatment techniques should be developed to enhance the biodegradability and digestibility of lignocellulosic biomass into biofuel and other useful products. The application of innovative technologies including artificial intelligence, robotics, smart metering, and machine learning should be adopted to minimize energy consumption, reaction time, and monitoring of processes and products of the various pretreatment processes. More investigations should be commissioned to develop state-of-the-art and practicable pretreatment processes for wastewater, animal waste, and other forms of waste. More studies are required on the techno-economic and environmental analyses, and life cycle assessments of these pretreatment techniques to identify and recommend the best method of improving the biodegradability and digestibility of waste. among the techniques.
