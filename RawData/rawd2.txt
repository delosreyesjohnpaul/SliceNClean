1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background of the Study
Farming animals is a big part of the farming business in Cagayan, Isabela, Philippines. The
animal farming business is very important to the region's farm economy. It deals with things like
chickens, pigs, goats, and sheep (Ortega et al., 2021). From January to March 2023, the
Philippines reported that chicken production was about 470 thousand metric tons. This is a
yearly increase of around 3% from the same lime in 2019, when there were only about 455
thousand metric tons produced. By March 31, 2023, there were a total of 195.48 million
chickens on hand. This was 3% more than last year's count of 189.7 million birds. The number
of native or improved chickens and broiler chickens went up by 5.6% and 2.1%, respectively,
according to the Philippine Statistics Authority's report from 2023. (Philippine Statistics
Authority)
Furthermore, in Isabela, they grow important farm crops. This includes animals such as cattle
and chickens. (Isabela Economic Website 2023). Even though the Philippines is growing its live
poultry industry, it's also making more people sick from chicken diseases. (Salvador et al.,
2020). Additionally, according to a news report from the Department of Agriculture, around
39,000 birds were killed at a farm near Manila to stop bird flu from spreading. (Reuters, 2020).
Common chicken diseases that all farrns face are coccidiosis, salmonella, and Newcastle. If
these illnesses aren't found early on, they can cut down a farm's number of chickens produced.
Checking for illnesses early can help control sickness and make poultry healthier. When
checking for Salmonella, Coccidiosis, and Newcastle illnesses in labs using poop samples, it
takes 3-4 days. Getting to these lab services is not cheap, and it's also restricted for farmers.
Methods called deep leaming have shown they can make machines do the tests for detecting
diseases in humans and animals. Also, the Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
model can help in finding some poultry diseases early (Mbelwa et al., 2021).
Recently, using deep learning techniques like convolutional neural Networks (CNN) for finding
out poultry diseases have become very popular. Kholil et al. (2022) made a system using CNN
to sort out illnesses in chickens with pictures of their poop. This helps farmers spot problems
easier, making production better. Zhou and his team (2023) used a faster R-CNN to find weird
chicken poop. They showed that CNNs are good at identifying diseases in animals, especially
because they can recognize things well and work in many different situations.

1.2 Objectives of the Study

The main goal of that research was to assess the performance of the latest top-notch

researchers aiming to employ convolutional neural networks and transfer learning methods in
their projects. Subsequently, experts can explore enhanced methodologies to achieve even
greater precision in their studies. The compiled, refined, and expanded lists will be made
accessible to the public, supporting the broader research community.

was subsequently employed in a mobile application.
The study focused on exploring diverse CNN designs commonly utilized in mobile and internet
applications, including InceptionNet, VGGNet, and MobileNet. The datasets used for training the
models comprised collections released by other researchers.

1.4.2 Delimitations
The diseases were not further classified, and the study was solely concerned with categorizing
chicken illnesses, thus refraining from training the models to identify the overall health of the
chickens. Additionally, the chicken species included for disease classification were broilers.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
This chapter includes discussions about related literature, the conceptual model of the study,
and the operational definition of terms.
2.1 Review of Related Literature
This section includes the ideas, generalization or conclusions, methodologies, and other
information that are relevant and similar to the present study.
2.1.1 Poultry Disease Overview
Diseases in poultry are a big issue for the chicken business. They can affect the health of
animals and people, too. Checking chicken sickness by looking at poop can help find out how
healthy the birds are. Many studies show that watching out for sick chickens and possible
dangers from germs is important.
According to Ali et al. (2019), coccidiosis is a big problem for birds called chickens. Blake et al.
(2020), who also wrote about it recently, explained that it is a result of parasites from the Eimeria
species and is expensive to treat. Coccidiosis is a big sickness in birds caused by germs called
Eimeria. It costs lots of money to fix and impacts the business that raises poultry.

Moreover, salmonella is also a big issue in farming feathered animals because it's so common
and can resist many types of medicine at once. Research shows that Salmonella germs are
often seen in bird poop, suggesting they might help spread the bacteria (Babatunde et al.,
2017).
Additionally, Parvee et al. (2022) emphasized the importance of considering the levels of
Newcastle disease found in chicken feces, along with its potential impact on the health of birds,
primarily chickens, due to its easy spread. Furthermore, Mugide et al. (2022) asserted that
understanding the visual characteristics of bird feces can provide valuable insights into their
health conditions. It is noteworthy that regular chicken feces may exhibit various colors, such as
brown, green, yellow, or white, with occasional occurrences of black (Alon, 2020). In the case of
sick birds, signs of illness may manifest in changes to the appearance of their feces, possibly
linked to issues related to eating or breathing.
2.1.2 Chicken color droppings in CNNs
Ahmed et al. (2021) emphasized the significance of classifying poultry diseases based on the
color and texture of droppings, highlighting this as a critical aspect of poultry farming. Numerous
studies have been conducted to devise systems and methods for the early detection and
diagnosis of diseases in poultry chickens. They proposed an loT-based predictive service
framework for the early identification of diseases in poultry chickens.
According to Merzlova et al. (2022), the color and texture of poultry droppings offer valuable
insights into chicken health. They underscored the importance of poultry droppings as a source
of nutrients for microorganisms and plants, noting that alterations in color and texture could
signity underlying health issues in the chickens.
Mugide et al. (2022) also emphasized the impact of diseases on the color of chicken droppings,
indicating that respiratory diseases in infected fowl may affect the sounds produced, while
digestive diseases influence the color of the droppings. This underscores the importance of
considering both color and texture for effective disease classification. Additionally, they utilized
machine vision technology to differentiate freshly slaughtered wholesome chickens from
systemically diseased chickens based on carcass and viscera correlation, showcasing the
potential of technology in disease classification.
Enahoro et al. (2021) highlighted the prevalence of infectious poultry diseases, such as
Newcastle disease, in village poultry systems, underscoring the significance of disease
resistance in poultry. This underscores the importance of accurate disease classification
methods for effective disease management. Similarly, based on Halder et al. (2021), a study
was conducted to determine the prevalence of common bacterial diseases like colibacillosis,
salmonellosis, and fowl cholera infection in commercial poultry farms, further emphasizing the
imperative need for accurate disease classification in disease control and prevention.

In Girma et al.'s (2022) study, the effective utilization of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for
the classification of poultry diseases underscores the importance of comprehending the diverse
diseases impacting poultry. Worldwide, poultry diseases represent a significant threat to poultry
production. In relation to review Wang et al. (2019) proposed a deep CNN-based approach for
recognizing and classifying broiler droppings, offering technical support for the detection of
digestive diseases in broiler production.
Concurrently, Ahmed et al. (2021) highlighted the application of supervised machine learning
algorithms and deep learning techniques to classify poultry diseases with enhanced accuracy.
The effective deployment of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer leaming is
emphasized. The utilization of CNNs and transfer leaming has demonstrated promising
outcomes across various fields, including agriculture and medicine.
2.1.3 Machine Learning in the Poultry Industry
Machine learning (ML) has found increasing applications in poultry farming, contributing to the
enhancement of various production and management aspects. Techniques in Ml. are employed
for predicting disease outbreaks, monitoring poultry health, and optimizing overall farm
operations.
According to Neethirajan (2022), the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning (ML.) in the poultry farming industry holds the potential to revolutionize production and
disease management. Automated tracking systems, driven by Al, improve the assessment of
farmed poultry, enabling more effective monitoring of their health and behavior. Beyond disease
prediction and monitoring, ML is also leveraged to optimize farm management.

Liakos et al. (2018) discuss the evolution of farm management systems into real-time Al-
enabled programs by applying ML to sensor data, providing rich recommendations and insights

for farmer decision support. Furthermore, Bhagat et al. (2022) highlights the growing interest in
the advancement of Al and ML techniques within the poultry farming industry.
In the study by Kamilaris & Prenafeta-Boldú (2018), the application of deep learning in
agriculture is explored, shedding light on the potential of these techniques to address various
industry challenges. Reviews underscore the use of deep learning methods for tasks such as
weed detection, plant stress identification, disease diagnosis, crop recognition, and the
detection, counting, and tracking of poultry. Moreover, Ünal (2020), Dokic et al. (2020), and
Priya et al. (2022) emphasize the relevance and applicability of deep learning techniques in
agricultural industries, particularly within the context of poultry farming.
Machine leaming (ML) has emerged as a pivotal tool in the agricultural sector, presenting new
avenues to tackle diverse challenges in poultry farming. Ayoola et al. (2022) utilized both
traditional and deep learning approaches to identify critical farm and environmental variables
influencing multidrug resistance in poultry pathogens.

In the study by Darwin et al. (2021), the incorporation of deep learning in agriculture is linked to
achieving heightened accuracy and improved performance in smart farming applications.
Bhagat et al. (2022) underscored in their review that machine leaming and deep learning
models in agriculture, including livestock management relevant to the poultry farm industry, have
gained popularity, showcasing the effectiveness of artificial and deep neural network methods
across various processes.
Ünal (2020) highlighted the potential of deep learning techniques in agriculture, especially in
addressing challenges specific to the poultry farm industry. The importance of continuously
measuring and evaluating the hygienic status of poultry farms was emphasized, aligning with
the potential of machine learning in adopting data-driven approaches.
Cakic et al. (2023) described the application of high-performance computing and deep learning
to create prediction models for deployment in poultry farms, showcasing the potential for
advanced technologies to enhance farm management. This aligns with the capacity of machine
learning to offer predictive insights into poultry farm managemerit.
A study by Borgonovo et al. (2020) found a strong link between data on air quality and the
presence of coccidia infections in broiler houses. This shows that data-driven prediction
methods could be useful in early disease warning systems for poultry farms,
Meanwhile, Ahmed et al. (2021) state that the challenges associated with machine learning in
chicken and poultry farming are multifaceted and necessitate a comprehensive thematic
approach. One of the key challenges addressed is the early detection of diseases in poultry
chickens, which can be mitigated through loT-based predictive services using machine learning
and deep learning classification models. Bagrow (2020) emphasizes the democratization of Al
and the involvement of non-experts in designing prediction tasks, recognizing that many poultry
farmers lack expertise in Al and ML, supporting the idea of creating user-friendly ML. systems
for poultry farmers.
2.1.4 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
As per Khan et al. (2020), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) stand out as a significant
breakthrough in the realm of image processing and computer vision. The architecture of CNNS,
enabling the direct extraction of features from images, has revolutionized the approach to image
processing tasks. Moreover, in accordance with Zhou (2020), CNNs are crafted to mimic the
visual perception process of the human brain, finding extensive application in pattern
recognition and image analysis (Hardjita et al., 2022). The universality of deep CNNs has been
demonstrated, illustrating their capacity to approximate any continuous function with sufficient
depth and showcasing their potential for complex function approximation tasks.
Furthermore, Fang & Cheng (2022) assert that the effectiveness of CNNs has been further
heightened through advancements such as the utilization of second harmonic superposition

activation functions and data augmentation techniques. These enhancements have contributed
to improved performance in image classification and signal processing tasks.
In the paper by Singh et al. (2020), it is noted that the effectiveness of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) has significantly improved through advancements in various fields. Since the
success of AlexNet in 2012, CNNs have been increasingly employed in medical image analysis,
resulting in enhanced efficiency in diagnosing medical conditions. Moreover Dong (2023)
underscores that the pooling architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNN) has been a
focal point of extensive research and development in the realms of computer science and
artificial intelligence. CNNs are specifically designed for spatial hierarchies of feature extraction,
encompassing convolution layers, fully connected layers, and pooling layers.
The extensive research and development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image
processing have been evident in recent years, as emphasized by Yamashita et al. (2018). CNNs
find widespread application in computer vision, medical image analysis, and various other fields
due to their innate ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features
through a backpropagation algorithm.
Suárez-Paniagua & Segura-Bedmar (2018) highlighted that the pooling layer plays a pivotal role
in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by reducing the dimensionality of the convolution layer
output. This reduction is achieved while retaining pertinent features and eliminating irrelevant
details. In a similar vein, Chen et al. (2020) emphasized the significance of transfer learning,
which involves the reuse of knowledge or features from one task to address a related task. This
approach diminishes the reliance on extensive labeled data in the target domain.
To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of CNNs, various studies have proposed innovative
pooling methods and architectures. For instance, a study introduced an improved pooling
method grounded in optimal search theory for the CNN pooling layer. This method aims to
achieve optimal pooling effects and higher accuracy in image recognition (Lai et al., 2019).
2.4.5 Transfer Learning
According to Zhuang et al. (2019), transfer learning emerges as a potent technique in machine
learning, aiming to enhance the performance of target leamers on specific domains by
transferring knowledge gleaned from related source domains. This approach has gamered
significant attention across diverse fields, including computer science, artificial intelligence, and
robotics, due to its potential to address data scarcity, enhance learning performance, and
improve model generalizability (Samala et al., 2017).
Cheng et al. (2021) asserted that the concept of transfer learning traces its historical roots back
to cognitive science and has found successful applications in fields such as reinforcement
learning. Kariuki et al. (2023) elaborate on the approach, describing it as involving the
fine-tuning of a pre-trained model on a new dataset. This fine-tuning allows for the leveraging of

knowledge from pre-trained models acquired from large-scale datasets, resulting in improved
performance and mitigating the limitations associated with small datasets,
According to Chen et al. (2020), transfer learning has shown promise in addressing the issue of
limited datasets, particularly in the development of a diagnostic tool for pathological image
classification. Kimura et al. (2019) highlight the effectiveness of retraining deeper layers close to
the end of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for improved predictions, underscoring the
potential of transfer learning in enhancing CNN performance. Meanwhile, Long et al. (2019)
tackled the issue of limited labeled information in the target domain, emphasizing the
importance of transfer leaming in adapting CNNs to new domains where direct fine-tuning is
impractical or may lead to overfitting.
2.1.4 Problems in Poultry Farm
In the comprehensive review by Ismoyowati et al. (2022), the management of poultry diseases
emerges as a multifaceted challenge for farmers. Various pathogenic bacteria have inflicted
substantial economic losses on the global poultry sector, adversely affecting chicken output.
Common diseases can swiftly spread among poultry, with bacterial infections like colibacillosis,
salmonellosis, and fowl cholera identified by Halder et al. (2021) as significant impediments to
the poultry industry's growth. Understanding the prevalence of these diseases on commercial
poultry farms is vital for implementing targeted control measures.
Author's view
The researcher's perspective that the detection of chicken diseases using manure has
underscored the pivotal role of image processing. The practice of trickle-down farming, coupled
with the absence of accurate data, has contributed to the rampant spread of diseases in the
poultry industry. Currently, farmers heavily rely on accessible experts for diagnosis. However,
the integration of artificial intelligence and machine leaming techniques, including convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), presents an opportunity to partially automate diagnostics for common
chicken diseases.

known as Google Colab, served as the chosen platform. Google Colab is a cloud-based
environment that enables users to write and execute Python code collaboratively. As part of the
Google Drive suite of productivity applications, it is specifically designed to facilitate the
development of machine learning and data analysis projects. Offering a free Jupyter notebook
environment, Google Colab requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. Additionally, it
provides free access to GPU and TPU resources, crucial for training deep learning models and
processing large datasets.
TensorFlow and Keras collectively form the high-level API of the TensorFlow platform. This API
provides an accessible and highly productive interface for solving machine leaming (ML)
problems, particularly focusing on modern deep learning. Covering every step of the machine
learning workflow, from data processing to hyperparameter tuning to deployment, Keras was
developed with an emphasis on enabling fast experimentation. It is an open-source frontend
library for neural networks that grants full access to the scalability and cross-platform
capabilities of TensorFlow. Whether running on a TPU pod, large GPU dusters, or exporting
models for deployment in the browser or on mobile devices, Keras ensures versatility in
implementation.

Table 3-1 shows the software and hardware specifications of the laptops and mobile phones
that were used in the application development stage of this study. Two mobile phones used
high- quality cameras and low-quality cameras to test if the model could still accurately classify
chicken manure disease even if it was a low-quality image.
3.5 Methods
3.5.5 Dataset Creation

3.5.5.1 Dataset Acquisition
This study utilized a dataset obtained from a parallel research endeavor, sourced and
downloaded from Kaggle. The data collection occurred in the Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions of
Tanzania between September 2020 and February 2021, facilitated through the Open Data Kit
(ODK) app on mobile phones. The dataset encompasses four distinct classes: salmonella,
coccidiosis, Newcastle disease, and healthy. To standardize the dataset, all images were
resized to 224px by
224px
Figure. 1 show sample images of the dataset
3.5.5.2 Training-Validation Data Split
The manure image dataset comprised a total of 6,812 images. These images were categorized
into four classes: salmonella, coccidiosis, Newcastle disease, and healthy. The dataset
underwent division for training and validation purposes, with 70% allocated for the training set,
20% for the validation set, and the remaining 10% for the test set. The training set played a
crucial role in training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to classify various
manure diseases. The set not used during the training phase served as the remaining validation
and test sets.
3.5.5.3 Image Augmentation
Image augmentation plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance and robustness of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This technique involved artificially increasing the size of
the training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing images, including
rotation, flipping, scaling, and adding noise. Its significance was particularly notable in
addressing challenges such as overfitting, data scarcity, and sample imbalance in CNN-based
deep-learning tasks (Guo et al. 2023).
To mitigate overfitting during training, the study employed the Keras ImageDataGenerator, a
Python library, to augment additional images through operations such as rotation, flipping,
scaling, zooming out, and zooming in. Furthermore, the augmentation technique was not solely
employed to prevent overfitting, it also aimed to rectify sample imbalances within the images,
contributing to improved accuracy in the model.
The study used a python library called Augmentor (Bloice et al., 2019) to automate the process
of performing image augmentation on the datasets. Augmentor works by building a pipeline
where different operations such as rotation and random zooming are defined along with a
number that defines the probability that the operation will be executed when the image dataset
passes through the pipeline.

3.5.5.4 CNN architecture model
The study employed three different pre-trained CNN architectures-InceptionNet, MobileNet, and
VGGNet-using specific versions of each architecture.
VGG16
The study utilized a pre-trained VGG16 architecture model-a convolutional neural network
renowned for its effectiveness in large-scale image recognition and widespread use in transfer
learning applications. It was chosen for its superior performance in specialized tasks,
adaptability for domain-specific modifications, and efficiency in the training and development of
the model. Fecal image dataset pre-processing involved normalization and augmentation using
the Image Data Generator. The numerical values in the input images were normalized to the
range [-1,1]. Augmentation included vertical and horizontal flipping, shifting width and height by
50%, a rotation range of 90 degrees, and varied brightness. Post-augmentation, the dataset
was divided into training (70%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%). Images were resized to
224 x 224 pixels, and the batch size was set to 32. Before training, the training data was
shuffled (shuffle=true), and all pre-trained layers of the base model were frozen. A new fully
connected layer was created using the flattened outputs of the base model, followed by dense
layers with 4,096 and 1,072 neurons, both employing the ReLU activation function. A dropout of
0.2 and a dense layer with Softmax activation for the final prediction of four classes were
applied. Fine-tuning of the VGG16 model involved unfreezing the last two pre-trained layers and
lowering the leaming rate to enhance the fully connected layer's leaming of robust patterns
Inception V3
In a separate experiment, the study employed the InceptionV3 model, known for its ability for
multiple feature extraction, adaptable filter size, and extraction of features at varied scales. This
adaptability enables the effective capture of intricate details and patterns within images, making
it suitable for diverse tasks. Inception V3, a deep learning model based on convolutional neural
networks, was chosen for its release in 2015 with 42 layers and a lower error rate compared to
its predecessors. The second experiment followed a similar concept to the first, differing mainly
in the libraries utilized.
MobileNetV2
MobileNetV2 demonstrated improved state-of-the-art performance for mobile models across
various model sizes, as evidenced by studies (Sandler et al., 2018). The pre-trained
MobileNetV2 CNN model showcased its versatility and effectiveness as a tool in diverse
applications. It proved capable of enhancing mobile model performance, serving as a feature
extractor, and contributing to the development of accurate and efficient CNN architectures for a
broad range of classification tasks.

In the third experiment, the classifier concept remained consistent with the approaches used in
the preceding experiments.
3.5.6 Deploying models on a mobile device
After training, the model with the highest accuracy among the three was selected for
deployment on mobile device applications. To assess the accuracy of each model, both
validation and test sets were utilized. The trained models underwent conversion into a
TensorFlow (tflite) file format, enabling the use of the model on a mobile phone. TensorFlow
facilitates faster model execution without the need for Python dependencies.
During the development of the mobile app, Android Studio served as the primary tool. The
TensorFlow in Android Studio IDE featured a built-in library that streamlined the process-upon
importing the TensorFlow model file, there was no need to import each component individually.

5.4 Summary
The thesis proposal aimed to develop a diagnostic tool for chicken manure disease
classification using CNN transfer learning. The study highlighted potential benefits for
commercial farms, researchers, and future researchers. Visual Studio Code Ide and the Python
programming language are effectively used. Three pre-trained CNN models, namely

InceptionNet, VGGNet, and MobileNet, were used to train and compare their performance on a
dataset of chicken manure images. The results showed that MobileNet achieved the highest
accuracy of 92.13%, with a training time of 12.45 minutes. The study provided a valuable
solution for early disease detection and classification in the animal farming industry.
