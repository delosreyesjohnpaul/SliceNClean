computerized program improved performance focus today getting rid paper improves efficiency reduces human error allows information flow infrastructure without requiring timeconsuming data input process many business scenarios also lower chance misreading handwritten orders higher customer retention rate delivered quickly water billing system online project allows water district management post customers bill well water billing transactions customer details service record module account statement neumann states water billing system necessary tool help small towns utility suppliers bookkeepers owners administrators auditors unify water billing services clients service providers receive reliable correct billing details aurora water district governmentowned water company provides drinking water waste water services including sewage treatment aurora municipalitys residential commercial industrial sectors water industry excludes manufacturers suppliers bottled water component beverage production falls food sector aurora water district currently serves barangays customers aurora municipality water company owned government already billing system according results thorough interview extremely difficult provide uptodate reporting using current system finding encoding customer data specifically meter readings water consumption timeconsuming user terms billing companys meter consumption analyst visits customers home read water consumption many days mca take deliver water bill motorcycle owner house occasionally away work town case mca leave bill customers front door gate time homeowners idea whether water bill current month issued result bill occasionally misplaced payment water bill delayed due date line researchers realized would better develop new system tested prospective respondents see actually works aurora water district customers chosen study participants proposed system would also change way current system works could impact current employees
