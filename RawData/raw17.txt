ABSTRACT

Water is essential for life, but some people need safe water sources, which can have serious health consequences. Water safety issues are critical, so we should monitor water in real-time. Developing a system for detecting water quality has been the subject of extensive research, primarily based on costly and time laboratory tests. So researchers came up with the concept of developing a low-cost and efficient water quality monitoring system. This paper aims to detect the quality of water that people use daily. The researchers implemented this project at Centro-3 Luna in Isabela and used an Arduino UNO, a pH and turbidity sensor for measuring the water value. Water value will be displayed on LCD or smartphone using our application. This system will assist authorities in taking the necessary steps to provide solutions for the affected area. After analyzing the gathered information, the researchers concluded that 54 per cent of our respondents are male, while 36 per cent are female. It also reveals that 58 per cent of the respondent are using tap water as their drinking water, while 42 per cent are drinking mineral water. The evaluation of the user "Strongly Agreed" with the Water Quality Monitoring System in terms of functional suitability, performance efficiency. compatibility, usability, reliability, security, maintainability, and portability. The researchers concluded that the respondents were satisfied with the system's performance.



CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

Project Context

Water is essential for life on Earth. Unfortunately, many people are not able to get enough of it. There is a water crisis in many parts of the world, and people are having much trouble getting the water they need for drinking, cooking, bathing, and other activities, Women and children are the most affected by water pollution. Children are more vulnerable to diseases caused by dirty water. Women and girls often bear the burden of carrying water for their families for an estimated 200 million hours daily. People can improve their hygiene and sanitation practices with access to clean water. These make them less likely to get water-related diseases, which can be a big worry for parents. Additionally, having access to clean water can help communities earn an income from their water resources (Reid, 2021).

In the Philippines, over a billion people still live in areas where they do not have access to clean, safe water. Especially common in rural areas and lower-income cities, but it is also a problem in the country's biggest city, Metro Manila, Inefficiency in government-run water utilities makes it very difficult for people to get the water they need in quantity and quality (Tan, 2020). There are several reasons why cities in the Philippines are having trouble dealing with water shortages. One of the main reasons is that the government has not planned well, and many different institutions are responsible for water management (Rola, 2019). There is a pandemic called COVID-19, and it has been making many people sick. Millions of people are struggling to survive and stay healthy during this crisis, and one of the biggest challenges they face is not having access to clean water. Essential during a pandemic when people are more likely to get sick if they do not have access to clean water.

In Isabela, residents and local officials are upset because they believe that the city officials and the Isabela Water District did not prepare for the increase in people and water usage (Unson, 2020). Access to safe water can be a huge time-saver for many people. It can also make people more confident and psychologically happier, leading to more opportunities to challenge themselves and create solutions to issues. Ensuring that everyone has access to safe water is essential for the individual and society as a whole. Clean water is needed by the body every day; without safe water, people would not function appropriately (Earthbuddies, 2021).

After a long planning process and finding the right resources, the researcher proposed developing a low-cost water quality monitoring system to ensure the water we drink is safe. This paper focuses on the development of a cost-effective water quality monitoring system. The researcher is working on monitoring water quality cheaply and easily, so people can be sure the water they are drinking is safe. These will help protect people's health. Researchers will use a turbidity and pH sensor to determine water quality. The turbidity sensor detects the clarity of a water sample, while the pH sensor can measure alkalinity and acidity. The result is on the user's smartphone.

Objectives of the Study

The primary purpose of this study is to develop and implement the proposed study entitled "Water Quality Monitoring System for Centro 3, Luna, Isabela". Specifically, the study aims to:

1. identify the respondent's problem with their drinking water in terms of:

1.1 Tap Water Pros and Cons

1.2 Mineral Water Pros and Cons

3.8 portability.

Scope and Delimitation

This study focused on detecting the current, ongoing, and emerging problems regarding water quality, determining compliance with drinking water standards, and helping protect other beneficial users. The study was conducted in Centro- 3 Luna, Isabela. The study will take place from the second semester of the academic year 2021-2022 through the first semester of the following academic year 2022-2023. The study has two administrative respondents from Luna, Isabela, And the IT experts in the CCSICT faculty.

Moreover, the said system has its limitation; the water tester, a Ph sensor, and a Turbidity sensor can only test the quality of limited liquid samples. The study presents the Water Quality and Monitoring. This aspect will help them try and monitor their drinking water.





CHAPTER II

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE AND STUDIES

This chapter will review other researchers' works and studies related to the development of this project, which is the Water Quality Monitoring System. The researchers use this as a guide as they construct the project. Furthermore, the information in this chapter aids in familiarizing facts that are relevant and related to the current research.

Researchers conducted a literature review in the library and on the Internet, specifically in Google Scholar. Before starting any research, it is wise to familiarize oneself with what has been done before. This will help ensure that the work undertaken is relevant to the study. Additionally, it is essential to check for any possible research gaps to ensure that the work undertaken is up-to-date. That is what researchers are doing with this paperwork.

According to (Cabahug, 2018). The Philippines is a country that is rapidly growing and industrialized. Unfortunately, this growth has come at the cost of increased water pollution. Nearly half of all surveyed water bodies in the Philippines have good water quality, 40% have only fair water quality, and 13% have poor water quality. Around 50 of the 421 rivers in the Philippines are now considered to be "biologically dead," meaning they do not have enough oxygen to support most living things.

As stated in the study of (Walag et al., 2018), the Philippines is an archipelagic country with many islands and much water. The country is focused on water quality because it is an integral part of agriculture. There are many threats to Water quality, including the scarcity of potable water. The legal framework helps agencies carry out water quality control, usage, and management policies. This is important because it helps to reduce the environmental impact of poor population health. The fact that the Philippines is an island nation with lots of natural water resources does not mean everyone has access to clean water. 75% of the population who have low socioeconomic status and live in rural villages called barangays do not have access to clean water (United Nations, 2018). In 2017, 58% of households in urban areas in the Philippines used bottled water or refilling stations as their primary source of drinking water. Next, respondents said they got drinking water from a pipe running into their house, yard, or plot (Statista Research Department, 2021).

(Denchak, 2022), Water pollution happens when harmful substances (often chemicals or microorganisms) get into the water, making it less healthy and potentially dangerous to people or the environment.

Statement (Manriquez, 2020), water shortages are a common problem in the Philippines, and they can be terrible during the summer when there is an El Ni√±o. During these times, finding water during the day can be challenging, so people often have to bathe or wash dishes at night. These can be inconvenient, especially if we have to do chores during the night.

According to (World Health Organization, 2022). Water and sanitation are essential for preventing diseases. If these services are unsafe, people can get sick from drinking or using the water. Diseases like cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A. typhoid, and polio can spread through contaminated water and poor sanitation.

Based on the study of (Japitana et al., 2018), integrated technologies have been used to monitor water quality in the Philippines. Water is an essential commodity and is becoming scarce due to human activity and natural destruction. The Philippines has much water, but the country's rapid development, human activities, and poor policy implementation have led to the deterioration of water quality in many water bodies. Water quality monitoring can be tedious and expensive, but some technologies are used to achieve precise, periodic, real-time, and low-cost water quality monitoring.

As stated in the study of (Demetillo et al., 2019), a system for monitoring water quality in a large aquatic area using wireless sensor network technology is present. This system is easy to use and can be applied in remote rivers, lakes, coastal areas, and other water bodies. The leading hardware of the system consists of off-the-shelf electrochemical sensors, a microcontroller, a wireless communication system, and a customized buoy. The system detects water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH in a pre-programmed time interval. The prototype disseminates the gathered information in graphical and tabular formats through a customized web-based portal and preregistered mobile phones. The boy's stability in harsh environmental conditions, system energy consumption, data transmission efficiency, and web-based information display were carefully evaluated to check the system's effectiveness. The experimental results prove that the system has a great prospect and can be practically used for environmental monitoring. 

According to (Rowland, 2021), water quality monitoring equipment has used to see how a water source is doing. This information can help people make informed decisions about how to care for the water.

According to (Japitana et al., 2018), water is essential for many reasons. We are running out of it, and some of it is becoming polluted. The Philippines has much water, but it needs to be better used because of rapid development, human activities, and poor policy. Water quality monitoring (WQM) is a very tedious and expensive process. However, some new technologies could make it easier and cheaper. Some researchers are studying ways to use new technologies to monitor water quality very accurately, often without costing much. However, this would require a lot of research and development. We need a better way to do it often or cheaply.

As stated in the study of (Ignacio et al., 2019), people can get sick from drinking contaminated water if we do not take care of wastewater and faeces. Furthermore, if there are harmful bacteria or viruses in wastewater, it can cause people to get sick. In some cases, this can even lead to death.

According to (Ighalo et al., 2020), a researcher looked at water quality monitoring and assessment in Nigeria over the past two decades and found that there are still many problems with enforcing quality guidelines. Monitoring systems help ensure the safety of the water everyone is drinking.

As stated in the study of (Masangkay et al., 2020), cryptosporidium is a waterborne pathogen that can cause diarrhoea in infants and people with weakened Immune systems. The Philippines is susceptible to the effects of climate change and water shortages, so it is essential to have a water quality monitoring system to help track the quality of water people drink.

Based on the study of (Demetillo et al., 2019), water quality monitoring can be expensive and time-consuming. However, there are ways to measure water quality more cheaply and efficiently than before. One method is to use stationary equipment with a small coverage area. A newer method is to use a mobile surface vehicle, but this is more expensive and may not be available in some places.

As stated in the study by (Vidal et al., 2020), the water safety plan (WSP) approach ensures water quality is always good from the point it has collected to when it is drunk. These include using risk assessment and management practices to determine the most significant risks to water quality and then taking steps to fix those problems. Programs to help implement the WSP were needed to help make sure that the water supply is always safe,

According to (Araneta, DMT, 2022), this device can monitor water quality. It comprises several parts, including a computer, sensors, and a power bank. The computer can monitor the different water quality parameters, and the sensors can detect those parameters. The power bank can use to keep the device running, and the device can use to monitor water quality in real-time.

According to (World Health Organization, 2021), the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 (IMI-SDG6) helps to monitor different aspects of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to water, such as reducing poverty. improving health, and increasing education. The 2030 Agenda calls for universal access to water and sanitation services by 2030, and IMI-SDG6 helps to measure how close we are to achieving this goal. In addition, IMI-SDG6 looks at how inequalities in access to these services exist and how different groups of people are affected by them.

Based on (Sandoval et al., 2019) study, groundwater is essential to the Philippines' water resources. It can be helpful in areas where it usually does not Rain a lot and surface water is not as readily available. However, over the years, groundwater depletion and pollution have been problems in many parts of the Philippines.

Based on the study of (Tolentino et al., 2019). The system's proponents measured the system's efficiency and reliability. The data showed that the system increased efficiency and avoided fish kills in a controlled setting while outperforming the yield quality of a conventional setup in an intensive setting. Aquaculture is a farming method that uses water to raise fish. Aquaculture can be done in a controlled setting. where the farmer knows what they are doing, or in an intensive setting, where the farmer does not have control over the environment. One problem with intensive aquaculture is that it can result in low-quality fish or even fish kills. A water quality monitoring system uses sensors, microcontrollers, and a web application. The system monitors six different water quality parameters and keeps them at a desired level that is optimal for fish growth,

Based on the (Hong et al., 2021) study, water is essential for human survival and is always in demand. Water quality can traditionally be monitored. However, this is time-consuming and prone to inaccuracies. An Arduino-based sensor system was tested and found reliable but reliant on human assistance. The system could improve by making it more loT-friendly. In some parts of Bangladesh, there needs to be more safe drinking water. Because the country has a lot of different types of rocks, water can get contaminated by things like industrial pollution. To try to reduce the amount of water-related illnesses, scientists have developed a way to measure water quality using sensors. This system would allow the government to monitor water quality in specific areas and decide when and where to provide safe drinking water.

As stated in the study by (Yashwanth et al., 2020), a real-time water quality monitoring system helps utilities to monitor water quality more accurately because it is difficult to do this with traditional methods. Also, because our population is growing, water resources are limited, and our infrastructure needs to be updated.

Statement of (Sugapriyaa et al., 2018), an intelligent water quality monitoring system uses sensors to collect data about water quality. The data is transmitted to a computer, which can decide how to care for the water. The system is cost-effectivebecause it uses technology from the internet of things. This means many devices can be connected to the internet and share data.

Likewise, (Mukta et al., 2019), an IoT-based Smart Water Quality Monitoring (SWQM) system helps continuously measure water quality using four different parameters: pH, temperature, turbidity, and electric conductivity. An Arduino UNO and the data collected send to a written desktop application connected to sensors. NET. The application uses fast forest binary classifiers to determine whether a water sample is potable. They use Arduino microcontrollers in many scientific fields, including mechanics, electricity and magnetism, light and optics, and many more. You can use these devices to do more in-depth labs and programming (Chaudry, 2020).

According to (Jerom et al., 2020) study, an intelligent water quality monitoring system uses loT technology to monitor water quality in various water resources. This system is more effective and faster than traditional methods because it does not require people to collect water samples manually and can send real-time alerts about water quality. It is essential to continuously monitor water quality to ensure it is safe to drink. By using IoT technology, this system can help to prevent issues related to the environment.

By (Chowdury et al., 2019). The current water quality monitoring system is a manual system that is very time-consuming. This system would be easier to use and more accurate than the current one. Real-time data access could be done using remote monitoring and Internet of Things (IoT) technology. Suppose data is collected at an away site, and the value is above a threshold. In that case, an automated warning SMS alert will be sent to the person responsible for the water quality.

About (Parra et al., 2018), turbidity is a type of water particle concentration. It can help determine the health of a body of water but in some. Cases more are needed to quantify the turbidity more accurately. A sensor must be able to differentiate between different sources of turbidity. That is why turbidity monitoring is essential in fish farms. Also used to reduce waste, improve yields, and analyze water quality in various industries (Atlas Scientific, 2022). 

Based on (Apure, 2022), a pH sensor is a tool used to measure a solution's pH. It can be helpful in water quality monitoring, as it can tell us how acidic or alkaline the solution is. In most cases, a pH range of 0 to 14 is represented by a number on a scale. When a solution has a pH value of 7, this is considered neutral. Solutions with pH values above 7 are acidic, while those with a pH value of 7 or below are alkaline.

As stated in the study (Olatinwo & Joubert, 2019). There has been much interest in developing more efficient sensing systems to help us monitor water quality. Dirty water can significantly impact human, plant, and animal health. The new sensing systems are designed to work together with traditional systems to monitor water quality. This way, we can better detect and prevent water contamination.

According to (Koditala and Pandey, 2018). The water crisis is a risk worth worrying about because it is responsible for around 200 child deaths daily. Drinking unsafe water can also cause around 3.4 million deaths each year. Despite the advances in technology, there need to be better quality measures to measure the quality of drinking water. A new low-cost water quality monitoring system that uses emerging technologies such as loT, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing could replace Traditional ways of quality monitoring. This would help protect people in rural areas from dangerous diseases, such as fluorosis, bone deformities, and more. The proposed model has achieved an R-squared score of 0.933, which is very accurate.

According to (Daigavane & Gaikwad, 2020). Water quality can be monitored in real-time using a system that includes sensors to measure the physical and chemical parameters of the water. These parameters, such as temperature, PH, turbidity, and flow, can be measured. A core controller can process the data from the sensors, and then it can be viewed online using a WI-FI system.

According to (Hawari et al., 2022). This research is looking into creating a water quality monitoring system using IoT. This system would use three sensors to measure temperature, turbidity, and pH. This data would then be stored in a cloud and analyzed to measure water pollution levels. Additionally, a mobile application would be developed to monitor the data. The research is highly reliable and practical and has a good response time.

Statement of (Khaire & Wahul, 2018). Water quality monitoring is essential to protect our environment and natural resources from getting contaminated. Old methods used for water quality monitoring are time-consuming and not cost-effective. A newer, more cost-effective solution is to have real-time monitoring of water parameters using technology such as the Internet of Things, a wireless sensor network, and modern communication tools. If there is an emergency, this system will alert the user.

Based on the (Wen et al., 2020) study, a rise in water-borne diseases, such as diarrhoea and vomiting, is because we are drinking water that is polluted. These water-borne diseases can lead to death, so ensuring that the water we drink is safe is essential. Contaminating water with harmful bacteria is a much more significant threat to human health than previously thought.

The statement of (Budiarti et al., 2019) states that water is needed for people and other living things to live and stay healthy. Water consumption depends on the availability of water resources, like rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Sometimes, these resources become limited because of water pollution. To ensure water is used sustainably. we must manage water quality. One way to do this is to use an Internet of Things (IoT) system to measure water quality. This system can be an automated water monitoring system for surface water. In addition, it can be used to send data remotely between things. This way, we can keep track of water quality even when not around.

According to (Rahman et al., 2020). The water quality in Bangladesh is often difficult to access due to natural disasters and transboundary river issues. It is challenging to ensure that all people have access to safe drinking water. However, we must measure the water quality in the area to identify problems and take the necessary steps to solve them. Researchers have built a system that can measure the water quality in an area, and we have also created an interface so that anyone can access the data. This will help the government to monitor the water quality in the area and take the necessary steps to fix the problems.

According to (Mukta et al., 2019). This paper is about an intelligent water quality monitoring system using four physical parameters to measure water. Condition. Four sensors are connected to an Arduino-Uno, and the data from those sensors is transmitted to a desktop application. The application compares the data from the sensors with the WHO standard values and based on the results, it decides whether the water sample is drinkable.

As stated in the study by (Chowdury et al., 2019). The water quality monitoring system we are proposing uses sensors to collect data about water quality. This data can be accessed by people using remote monitoring and the Internet of things. If the data from the sensors suggests that the water quality is getting worse, it will send an alert to someone.

Based on the study by (Memon et al., 2020). The Internet of things (IoT) is a new technology where devices are connected to the Internet to share data. This allows us to monitor water quality in real-time, which is essential because it can help prevent water pollution. The design and implementation of this system were done with the help of an Arduino-like board and sensors that measure things like pH, turbidity, temperature, and ultrasonic waves. The system was tested, and it found that it takes less than a minute to update its values. This system is very cost-effective, and residents and industries can use it to monitor water quality.

After reviewing the literature, researchers recognize the importance of the chosen scholarly sources. The studies discussed above to enable us to analyze the literary material and conduct additional research on the theme with a focus on our specific topic area. In addition, related literature helps us search for or select a better research topic.

This fishbone diagram identifies the potential causes and effects of problems.

It depicts the problem on the diagram and illustrates the graphic representation. Tap water may save money, be environmentally friendly, and be easy to access. However, there are potential problems like water contamination, which is not always safe to drink and contains harmful chemicals that may lead to diseases like diarrhoea, hepatitis, and polio.

Mineral water may taste better, have a more extended storage capacity, and be safer to drink. However, it is also more expensive, the environment may be harmed, it contains microplastic that may deplete aquatic ecosystems, it may lead to chronic diseases such as cancer, and it costs more to produce plastic bottles.
