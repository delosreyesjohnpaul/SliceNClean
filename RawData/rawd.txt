1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

Education is universally recognized as a critical component of personal growth, social
mobility, and economic progress. It gives people the information, abilities, and skills they need to
prosper in the complicated world of today. However, despite its undeniable importance, one of the
persistent challenges undermining the transformative power of education is the issue of dropout.

Education plays a crucial role in the development and preparedness of the Philippines
(Hoffmann & Muttarak, 2018). The multifaceted nature of the dropout problem has come to light in
research, which shows that a variety of factors, including academic failure, social, personal,
psychological, and economic variables, influence it (Thumiki, 2019). The impact of dropout is
substantial, leading to negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole (Parreño,
2022). Despite efforts to address this issue, dropout rates continue to rise, indicating the complexity
of the problem due to the numerous variables involved (Villalba et al., 2023).

The issue of student dropout is a significant concern in the field of education, particularly in
higher education institutions. Various factors contribute to student dropout, including socioeconomic
status, academic performance, mental health, and adaptation to the educational environment (Dalipi
et al., 2018). Kabathova and Drlik (2021) emphasize the prevalence of student dropout in both
traditional and e-learning educational settings, highlighting the challenges associated with this issue
(Dalipi et al., 2018; Kabathova & Drlik, 2021).

Manila, Philippines, projected that the attrition rate, or the number of students who dropped
out of universities and colleges in the school year 2023–2024, is currently at 35.15 percent, slightly
lower than the 40.98 percent the previous year, according to the Commission on Higher Education
(CHEd). According to Gatchalian, universities and colleges had an attrition rate of 15.90 percent in
the school year (SY) 2020–2021, but jumped to 37.79 percent in SY 2021–2022, then further to
40.98 percent in SY 2022–2023. However, De Vera clarified that the rate has begun to decrease,
with CHEd projecting a 35.15 attrition rate in FY 2023–2024.

It is evident that addressing the dropout problem requires a comprehensive understanding
of the various factors contributing to it. This includes recognizing the influence of school factors on
students' educational decisions and the need for effective policies and interventions to prevent
dropout (EL, 2020). Moreover, the use of machine learning techniques and data mining algorithms
has been proposed to predict and tackle the dropout problem, highlighting the potential for
technological solutions in addressing this issue (Dalipi et al., 2018; Vasconcelos et al., 2019).

To analyze dropout, various studies have employed machine learning algorithms to predict
dropout occurrences. The random forest algorithm has been compared with other models,
demonstrating its superior performance in predicting gene expression and student dropout (Xie et
al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2022). Furthermore, research has shown that the random forest algorithm,
when trained with big data samples, can effectively predict high school student dropout rates (Lee &
Chung, 2019). Moreover, the random forest algorithm has been utilized for early detection of
university dropout, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting dropout based on student
background and academic factors (Flores et al., 2022).

A lot of prediction models have also used the random forest algorithm to look at things like
supply fraud, customer churn, post-operative mortality in elderly patients, solar radiation, and more
(Xing et al., 2022; Kor, 2021; Pan, 2022; "Accuracy Measure of Customer Churn Prediction in
Telecom Industry using Adaboost over Random Forest Algorithm," 2022). A brand-new statistical
method called generalized mixed-effects random forest (GMERF) has been suggested as a way to
use random forest to look at hierarchical data, showing that it can work with a variety of response
variables (Pellagatti et al., 2021). The random forest algorithm has also been compared to decision
trees and deep learning algorithms, and the results show that it is better at predicting early dropouts
in online learning and postgraduate student dropout analysis (Park & Yoo, 2021).

There are many different factors that play a role in the complex and multifaceted problem of
educational dropout. Addressing this problem requires a holistic approach that considers academic,
social, economic, and cultural aspects. Furthermore, the potential for technological solutions and the
need for effective policies and interventions are crucial in mitigating the impact of dropout on
individuals and society. The random forest algorithm has been widely utilized in predicting dropout
occurrences across various domains, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility in handling
different types of data and achieving superior predictive performance.

burgeoning interest in harnessing machine learning to formulate scalable solutions for dropout
prediction.

According to Mduma et al. (2019), a survey was conducted on machine learning approaches
and techniques for predicting student dropout, highlighting the potential of machine learning in
addressing dropout issues. Similarly, Lee and Chung (2019) developed a machine learning-based
dropout early warning system to enhance the accuracy of dropout prediction, emphasizing the
utilization of diverse machine learning algorithms for early detection. Furthermore, Oqaidi et al.
(2022) focused on detecting student dropout in higher education institutions using machine learning
algorithms, providing critical analysis and recommendations to overcome the limitations of existing
models.

Overall, research on machine learning in dropout prediction has showcased its effectiveness
in developing accurate and scalable models for identifying at-risk students across various
educational settings. The application of machine learning algorithms has yielded promising results
in enhancing the performance of dropout prediction systems, thereby paving the way for more
effective interventions to support student retention in educational institutions.

COLLEGE OF COMPUTING STUDIES, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY

Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 11
attention. Researchers have delved into the application of various algorithms to analyze factors
contributing to student dropout rates, aiming to enhance predictive accuracy and identify at-risk
students (Vasconcelos et al., 2019). Data mining, specifically Educational Data Mining (EDM), has
been instrumental in uncovering hidden patterns within educational datasets, aiding in the
development of predictive models to mitigate dropout rates (Palacios et al., 2021). By exploring
variables that influence student dropout through supervised data mining approaches, researchers
have strived to enhance the understanding of dropout phenomena and improve intervention
strategies (Yaacob et al., 2019).

Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of data mining algorithms, including Random Forest,
in educational settings by analyzing real data to predict student outcomes and dropout rates (Bulut
& Yavuz, 2019). The application of Machine Learning (ML) and EDM techniques has enabled
researchers to develop predictive models to identify students at risk of dropping out, facilitating the
implementation of preventive strategies (Colpo, 2023). Moreover, data mining has been instrumental
in revealing the relationship between various factors, such as ethnicity, and predicting students'
performance and dropout potential, thereby aiding in the enhancement of the learning process
(Adekitan & Salau, 2019).

The significance of data mining techniques in education extends to predicting and analyzing
students' academic performance and dropout indicators, providing valuable insights for educators
and policymakers (Nabil et al., 2021). Decision tree algorithms, such as C4.5, ID3, and CART, have
been applied to socioeconomic and demographic data to predict student dropout in adult literacy
programs, showcasing the utility of data mining in addressing dropout challenges (Tomori, 2023).
Furthermore, the comparison of predictive models using the SMOTE method has offered valuable

ISABELA STATE UNIVERSITY

COLLEGE OF COMPUTING STUDIES, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY

Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 12
insights into forecasting university dropout rates, emphasizing the importance of data mining in
enhancing student retention strategies (Flores et al., 2022).

Random Forest analysis, as a data mining technique, has been employed to identify factors
influencing student outcomes and distinguish between different groups based on academic
achievement levels (Hong et al., 2022). By leveraging EDM methods like random forest analysis,
researchers have been able to extract critical factors associated with student success and dropout,
aiding in the development of targeted interventions (Miranda & Guzmán, 2017). The application of
data mining in educational contexts has enabled the analysis of factors influencing student
performance, supporting efforts to enhance academic outcomes and retention rates (Carneiro et al.,
2022).

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, data mining techniques have been instrumental
in improving dropout forecasting and identifying at-risk students, particularly through feature
selection and neural network models (Nuanmeesri et al., 2022). By predicting students' academic
performance and behavioral features using data mining techniques, researchers have advanced the
field of education by providing insights into student outcomes and potential dropout risks (Almutairi
et al., 2019). The extraction of valuable knowledge from educational datasets through data mining
methods has become increasingly crucial in understanding and addressing factors affecting
students' performance and retention (Al-Hagery et al., 2020).

Random Forest stands out as a widely acclaimed ensemble learning method renowned for
its adaptability and resilience across diverse fields. Breiman first introduced Random Forest in 2001
(Fox et al., 2017), which consists of a collection of classification and regression trees, simple models
that use binary splits on predictor variables to derive outcome predictions. Operating as an ensemble

COLLEGE OF COMPUTING STUDIES, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY

Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 13
of decision trees, its fundamental principle lies in aggregating the predictions of individual trees to
determine the most prevalent class (Yu et al., 2020).

Moreover, the efficacy of Random Forest in dropout prediction has been underscored in
numerous studies. Lee & Chung (2019) showcased the potential of Random Forest in dropout
prediction by training it alongside other machine learning models using a sizable dataset of high
school students. Similarly, Sani et al. (2022) reported high accuracy in predicting student attrition
rates with Random Forest. Additionally, Dake & Buabeng-Andoh (2022) identified Random Forest
as the top-performing algorithm for forecasting learner dropout rates in higher educational
institutions.

In terms of dropout prediction accuracy and sensitivity, Random Forest has done better
than other machine learning algorithms like neural networks, support vector machines, and logistic
regression (Oqaidi et al., 2022). Behr et al. (2020), who used Random Forest based on conditional
inference trees to predict university dropout and obtained encouraging results from a comprehensive
German dataset covering various aspects of student life and study courses, further support this
observation. Moreover, Random Forest has emerged as the leading predictive model for dropout in
massive open online courses (MOOCs) (Dass et al., 2021), as well as in the study by Park & Yoo
(2021), where Random Forest algorithms demonstrated superior prediction and performance.

Managing thousands of variables without sacrificing accuracy, being quick, and being easy
to set up have all been named as big benefits of Random Forest, which further supports its
usefulness in predictive analysis (Sari et al., 2021). Random Forest isn't just used to predict dropouts
in education; studies have shown that it can also be used to predict dropouts from electronic health
platforms for lifestyle interventions (Pedersen et al., 2019).

In summary, the literature consistently champions the superiority of Random Forest over
other predictive analysis models in dropout prediction. Its robust performance, ability to handle
diverse datasets, and effectiveness across various domains position it as the preferred choice for
addressing the challenges associated with dropout prediction.

2.1.4 Factors that Contribute to Student Dropout

Student dropout is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by various factors that can be
categorized into different domains such as academic, personal, social, and environmental. Academic
factors like academic procrastination, low study satisfaction, and lack of motivation play a significant
role in students' intentions to drop out (Scheunemann et al., 2021). Additionally, academic
performance, course challenges, and GPA have been identified as crucial determinants of dropout
(Tayebi et al., 2021; Majumder & Mitra, 2020). Personal challenges such as mental distress, lack of
motivation, and emotional exhaustion can also contribute to students' decisions to leave their studies
(Wagner, 2024; Hartl et al., 2022). Moreover, factors like age, socioeconomic status, and parental
competence level have been found to impact dropout rates, with older students and socially
disadvantaged individuals being more prone to dropping out (Tayebi et al., 2021; Schuchart &
Schimke, 2021; Nurmalitasari et al., 2023).

The influence of environmental factors on student dropout cannot be overlooked. Factors
like home distance, family economic status, and parents' involvement in their children's education
have been highlighted as contributors to dropout rates ("Causes of Students’ Dropout in Public
Secondary Schools of Balochistan, Pakistan", 2022; Herman & Ligembe, 2022). The quality of the
school environment, student supervision, and the overall educational experience also play a crucial
role in determining whether a student stays in school or decides to drop out ("Causes of Students’

COLLEGE OF COMPUTING STUDIES, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY

Bachelor of Science in Computer Science 15
Dropout in Public Secondary Schools of Balochistan, Pakistan", 2022; Doe et al., 2022).
Furthermore, the impact of societal and cultural factors on dropout rates, such as race, ethnicity, and
cultural incompatibilities, has been noted in various studies (Majumder & Mitra, 2020; Kısa et al.,
2023).

In addition to these factors, the interplay between personal characteristics and external
influences further complicates the dropout phenomenon. For instance, students' intrinsic and
extrinsic motivations, as well as their need fulfillment and affective well-being, can affect their
decision to continue or discontinue their studies (Sosin, 2024). The presence of mental health issues,
high-risk behaviors, and low self-esteem can also contribute to dropout rates (Kamissa, 2020).
Moreover, the balance between academic responsibilities and external commitments, such as work
or family obligations, can influence students' ability to persist in their studies (Sáez et al., 2021;
Kocsis & Pusztai, 2020).

The problem of student dropout is complex and subject to many influences. Studies have
identified age as a significant contributor to dropout rates (Afia et al., 2019; Sánchez-Gelabert, 2021;
Giese, 2020; Taylor & Bicak, 2019). Additionally, regardless of age, students' economic situations,

especially among working students, have been linked to higher dropout probabilities (Sánchez-
Gelabert, 2021). Adult learners aged 25–34, in particular, often face insufficient support from federal

and institutional financial aid, leading to elevated dropout rates and lower graduation rates (Taylor &
Bicak, 2019).

Academic challenges, such as stress, failure to meet previous performance levels, and
inadequate support from professors, significantly impact students' persistence (Bergmann et al.,
2019; Morava et al., 2023; Lines et al., 2021). Personal challenges, including burnout, work-family

conflict, and a sense of lack of control, also affect students' mental health and academic performance
(Aguayo et al., 2019; Toyon, 2023; Wilkins-Yel et al., 2022). Moreover, the difficulty of courses and
satisfaction with course content can contribute to dropout rates (Radovanović et al., 2021; Bernardo
et al., 2022).

Parental competence is another significant factor influencing student dropout rates. Studies
have highlighted the impact of parental qualifications, income stability, and attitudes towards
education on dropout probabilities (Rincón et al., 2021; Gagica et al., 2022). Lack of parental support
and home-related factors also play crucial roles in students' decisions to drop out (Wells, Bechard,
& Hambly, 2001; "Causes of Students’ Dropout in Public Secondary Schools of Balochistan,
Pakistan," 2022).

Class attendance is frequently cited as a primary indicator of students' persistence, with
lower attendance correlating with higher dropout risks (Pinter et al., 2020; Gil, 2020). Academic
aspects such as attendance percentage are key attributes affecting dropout rates (Gil, 2020; Benden
& Lauermann, 2020). Poor school attendance is closely linked to negative outcomes for students,
including perceptions of a poor school climate and underperformance academically (Benden &
Lauermann, 2020; Rifenbark et al., 2023).

Stress plays a pivotal role in student dropout rates within higher education settings. Studies
indicate that negative affectivity, encompassing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress,
heightens students' inclination to abandon their courses (Souza et al., 2022). Furthermore, the
reciprocal relationship between academic procrastination, study satisfaction, and dropout intentions
underscores the profound influence of psychological factors on dropout decisions (Scheunemann et
al., 2021).

However, Farliana et al. (2022) posited that excessive engagement in extracurricular
activities could lead to academic dishonesty due to time constraints, revealing a potential downside
to extensive participation in such activities. This observation raises concerns about maintaining
student academic integrity and performance. Moreover, Özkan (2020) found that students involved

in extracurricular activities exhibited lower academic achievement compared to their non-
participating counterparts, suggesting potential trade-offs between extracurricular engagement and

academic performance that could impact dropout rates.

Part-time employment emerges as another significant contributor to student dropout. Rincón
et al. (2021) highlighted that parents of dropouts typically have lower educational attainment levels
and engage in unpaid or part-time work, such as housekeeping. Additionally, Marina and Senthilrajan
(2023) emphasized that inaccurate time management for student jobs diminishes study time, further
exacerbating dropout rates.

Student dropout constitutes a multifaceted issue influenced by various factors. Scholarship
availability, for instance, significantly impacts dropout probabilities, as evidenced by research
(Jaksztat et al., 2021). Financial support, including scholarships, proves decisive for course
completion duration and overall academic progress (Rodrigues et al., 2019). Furthermore, financial
constraints, particularly prevalent when mothers have limited educational backgrounds, have been
linked to higher dropout rates (Pusztai et al., 2019).
