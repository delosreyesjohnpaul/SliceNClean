revealed among given characteristics portability efficiency ranked highest mean followed compatibility maintainability functional suitability security reliability usability findings revealed development mobile transportation application need address issues comfortability convenience greater security passengers using tricycle ode public transportation application performed function well could used target clients chapter introduction project context covid pandemic caused unprecedented global crisis led huge number deaths economic hardship disruption everyday life measures restrict accessibility adopted many countries swift yet effective response contain spread virus transport sector critical part getting economies moving curbing spread covid many must continue commuting rely public transport systems uniquely positioned carry large volumes passengers busy urban areas even pandemic public transport remains backbone sustainable mobility essential economic recovery one used transportation nowadays tricycles conventional way hailing tricycle done manually passengers would wait streets tricycles pass manual process could cause delays inefficient cater reach passengers cauayan city rd class component city province isabela philippines according census population people continuously embraces technology advancement partnership collaboration help every institution improve lives citizens make cities connected resilient digitally enabled transportation using mobile app software application designed run smart phones tablets mobile devices application commonly known mobile apps era rapid technological advances mobile applications become one primary tools use daily personal professional lives applications play key roles facilitating many applications important society today preassessment among chosen respondents revealed neutral view extent use choosing tricycle mode transportation city shown agreement use mobile transportation app capstone project conceptualized developed mobile trans app public transport designed specifically residents city cauayan visitors provincesplaces philippines visits place due large number visitors know ride tricycle city mobile app allows visitors people provinces use mobile phones gadgets easily find tricycle pandemic arisen still hitting country digitalization project cauayan city innovation helps constituents benefit programs different aspects including transportation easiest way ensure business continuity control pandemic encourage telecommuting still everyone work home many people need leave home generate income provision products services remains dependent workers accessing jobs hence need travel every day go respective fields offices nonowners vehicles experiencing problems transportation especially drivers according data reduced days going work due restrictions imposed iatf rides capacity cost increased fare highly signify importance developed trans app mobile transportation application tricycle passengers drivers objectives study main objective study develop transportation application system use mobile phone generally aims make public transportation safety comfortable convenient public use mobile application cauayan city isabela specifically aims determine extent choice respondents use tricycle mode public transportation cauayan city isabela determine perception respondents use transportation using mobile application public transportation describe perception respondents developed system terms functional suitability reliability usability security compatibility efficiency maintainability portability scope limitations scope study development transportation application specifically designed use tricycle drivers passengers city cauayan isabela applications feature involves creating account drivers passengers personal information given purpose safety legality transactions drivers motorcycle information also uploaded system process
