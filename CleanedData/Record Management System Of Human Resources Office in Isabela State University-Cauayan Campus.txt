office isabela state universitycauayan campus chapter ii review related literature studies review related literature studies according scott shpak doubleentry accounting timeconsuming manual system since cach transaction must manually recorded twice doubleentry method used many accounting programs second entry generated automatically minimize disparities first second submissions wont prevent someone entering wrong number according thomason businesses today may still use manual accounting processes manual accounting involves use paper ledgers journals record financial transactions lack security another common disadvantage manual accounting companies may unable prevent employees reviewing sensitive data paper ledgers journals according bailey small businesses owner main operator still make sense data entry manually although upgrading automatic system make smoother operations disadvantages human error speed labor costs according mukred amount information stored modern technology exponentially increasing access vast amounts information changed governments institutions organizations individuals conduct business record keeping increased use cloud computing conjunction recordkeeping management several government offices opted use computers store records easy access retrieval searching specific data files according mishra storage data using data effective manner major issues management system security data use data proper way important project record management system web applicationbased project designed hospital manage use patients data effectively projects main aspect providing system data stored retrieved easily according omuge governments research focused assessing records management systems aim looking systems use records handled according aziz one system think electronic document records management system edrms however people enthusiastic using adoption rate system remarkably satisfaction government invested significant sum money ensuring
