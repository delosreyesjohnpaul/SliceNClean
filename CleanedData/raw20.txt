according ibiblio identification fundamental activity one key goals systematics although identification distinct activity process classification nomenclature involved practice identification simply determining similarities differences two elements ie two elements comparing unknown plant named specimen determining two elements classification also involved one correctly determines unknown belongs group species genus family etc known specimen information stored classification systems becomes available applicable material hand according stieglitz et al terms dependability accuracy expert decision best method identifying general specialists published treatments monographs revisions synopses group question likely current floras manuals use experts taxonomic principles botanical gardens herbaria museums colleges universities common places find experts however despite high reliability method disadvantage demanding valuable time experts causing identification delays according jones another method identifying flowers using key many plant manuals plant identification books field guides contain tools key set questions statements specific plant feature must decide true description key matches plants physical appearance false description match physical appearance plant beginning comments questions concerning prominent visible traits branch leaf direction foliage color key created progress key statements questions become focused minor details presence absence leaf hairs floral elements following simplistic example demonstrate tool according mili process matching
