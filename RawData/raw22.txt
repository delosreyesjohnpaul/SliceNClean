ABSTRACT

Poultry is the most intensive branch of agriculture for ensuring food security of the country In the face of competition, the improvement of technology and technological equipment for production, sorting and sale of products become relevant. Huge amount of money and manpower are spent for sorting and packaging. The main disadvantages of manual sorting are inaccuracy and large labor costs. The productivity of manual sorting is less than 1000 eggs per hour. Human sorter is physically unable to detect many defects (eggs irregular shape, the notch of the shell, marbling, etc.) and do not accurately identify the eggs by weight. Therefore, most manufacturers widely use grading machines and complexes. The main criteria according to the standards for classification of eggs is their weight. The modified size classification system prescribed by the Philippine National Standard9 was used Jumbo (>70 g), Extra-large (65-69 g), Large (60-64 g), Medium (55-59 g). Small (45-54 g) and Peewee (<45 g).

The water fall model was used as a guide by the researchers to build the system and achieve the study's objectives. The main concem of this study is to attain the objective by following the process to create a successful project. The researchers identify and analyze what the project needs in detail to have the initiatives to begin with and get the idea or the main goal to initiate the project. The questionnaire was formulated to determine the opinion of the respondents. It consists of the weighted mean interpreted using the Likert Scale. The researchers used a descriptive method of research to describe the Sorting interface machine regarding design, performance, and functionality.

A collecting and sorting system has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of egg grading and classification in the poultry farming industry. By automating these processes, poultry farmers can save time and resources, leading to increased profitability and sustainability. The development of such a system is a promising and valuable endeavor. The ability to track the number of eggs sorted each day can help farmers to better understand and optimize their operations, leading to increased productivity and profitability. The development of an application that provides these capabilities would be a valuable tool for optimizing the use of a collecting and sorting system for eggs in the poultry farming industry. By using an HMI to view and manage data in a centralized location, it is likely that the efficiency and effectiveness of the process can be improved. The use of digital technologies can help to enhance the accuracy and reliability of data, which can further contribute to the optimization of the industrial process. 






1 INTRODUCTION

1.1

Background of the Study

Poultry is the most intensive branch of agriculture and is aimed at ensuring food security of the country. In the face of competition, the improvement of technology and technological equipment for production, sorting and sale of products become relevant. Huge amount of money and manpower are spent for sorting and packaging. The main disadvantages of manual sorting are inaccuracy and large labor costs. The productivity of manual sorting is less than 1000 eggs per hour. Human sorter is physically unable to detect many defects (eggs irregular shape, the notch of the shell, marbling, etc.) and do not accurately identify the eggs by weight. Therefore, most manufacturers widely use grading machines and complexes. (Alikhanov et al., 2019).

The main criteria according to the standards for classification of eggs is their weight. The modified size classification system prescribed by the Philippine National Standard was used Jumbo (>70 g), Extra-large (65-69 g), Large (60-64 g), Medium (55-59 g), Small (45-54 g) and Peewee (<45 g). Following the above-mentioned regulations, the operation of the existing machines is based on the weighting of each egg and separating it into proper category. However, in that case the productivity of the machine is limited by the speed of the weighting mechanism.

The other disadvantage of the existing commercial systems is the use of specific equipment, which leads to maintenance complexity and high cost. The existing systems for egg sorting include different kind of parameters like color, defects, size, etc., so separate sensors are used for determination of the individual quality indicators. There is much research published in the last 10 years that are related with the use of computer vision and artificial intelligence for the needs of food products quality control. (Zhandos Shynybay et al., 2020)

Egg classification is the process of grouping eggs into specific categories based on different factors that can help in determining the quality and suitability of eggs for different purposes. Some of the most common factors used for egg classification include size, color, type of bird, farming method, nutritional content, grade, purpose, and freshness. Farming method is another important factor for egg classification, with options such as free-range, cage-free, and organic. Nutritional content, such as omega-3 enriched eggs, is also used for classification. Eggs are also classified based on their quality, with AA, A, and B being the most common grades. The purpose for which the eggs are intended is also used for classification. Eating eggs, baking eggs, and hatching eggs are just a few examples of the different purposes for which eggs can be used. Freshness, including whether the eggs are fresh, fertilized, or pasteurized, is another factor that can be used to classify eggs.

Egg grading is the evaluation of egg quality based on factors such as size, weight, shape, yolk color, and interior quality. In the US, eggs are graded by the USDA into AA, A, or B grades. AA are the highest quality with firm yolks and thick whites, A are of good quality but with slightly thinner whites, while B have thin whites and runny yolks and are typically used for animal feed or liquid egg products. Other classifications, such as cage-free or organic, reflect the egg production conditions, not necessarily the egg quality.

The sorting and collecting of eggs in poultry production is a tedious and time-consuming activity. Care is taken, as eggs are delicate and require caution when working with them. This reduces productivity as a considerable amount of time is spent in the sorting of eggs into their various sizes before marketing. (Koranteng et al., 2020).

Farmers, on the other hand, invest a significant amount of money in the sorting process as many laborers are required in the collecting and sorting process. The profit generated after sales is disheartening. Ghana poultry sector for nearly a decade has contracted an intense competition from the import of poultry meat decreasing the profitability of egg production (Natalie Berkhout 2022).

Automating this process will help increase profit and improve productivity as well. Agribusiness is a field rising with technological advancements in recent times. Poultry production is undoubtedly one of the most lucrative and popularly known agriculture business ventures in the world. The ever-increasing needs have led to the development, adaptation and utilization of new standards and technologies in developed countries. Goal number two of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focuses on the eradication of hunger. While goal number 8 focuses on economic growth, goal number 9 focus on industry and innovation. These SDGs can be contributed to by the poultry production industries by implementing an efficient and cost-effective production chain. However, developing countries like Ghana still deploy traditional method of handpicking of eggs and their separation into various sizes.

Human Machine Interface (HMI) is a technology that allows for the interaction between humans and machines in a way that is intuitive and easy to understand. In the context of automated grading and classification of eggs in poultry farms, an HMI would be used to display information about the eggs being processed, as well as to allow for manual input and control of the egg sorting and grading process. It can help to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the sorting and grading process, reduce the need for manual labor, and increase overall productivity. Additionally, an HMI can provide farmers with real-time information about the eggs being processed, allowing for more effective monitoring and control of the egg grading process. (Ivy Wigmore 2019).

Researchers are coming up with innovative ideas and smart machinery to automate processes and increase production on a large scale. A field survey conducted in the western sector of the Greater Accra Region of Ghana to understand the challenges faced by poultry farmers, proved that poultry are only in demand during festive seasons hence, it is better to focus on the production of eggs to gain some profit than engaging in poultry production. Based on this survey, the incorporation of a design to aid in the easier sorting and collection of eggs will help increase productivity and generate more revenue for farmers. Hence this research seeks to design a collecting and sorting system incorporated with an Arduino Uno to aid in the sorting and collection of eggs in poultry farmers. (Agyei-Henaku, 2018).

2 THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

2.1

Review of Related Literature

An automatic system for eggs sorting by indirect weight and shape assessment, using computer vision, is presented. The system is equipped with a smart camera, controller, and electro pneumatic actuators. Image processing and analysis algorithms are developed to access some basic geometric characteristics of eggs. The overall sorting accuracy of the automatic system in each case is 94.6% and 90.3% respectively. (Jakhfer Alikhanov, Stanislav M. Penchev 2, Tsvetelina D. Georgieva 2. 2019)

Using computer vision, the determination of the egg mass is dependent on a measurement taken from the image. Once the computed measurement value is far from the exact value, it affects the determination of the eggs' mass. Indeed, a low-cost webcam could be used as a replacement for weighing regarding determining the egg's mass with the aid of the right image processing and analysis algorithm. With the 96.31% accuracy, this study could greatly be an alternative way in the chicken egg weight estimation method especially in large-scale poultry farms in the Philippines to minimize human interaction during the process as well as to save time and energy. (Val Irvin F. Mabayo 2018)

Their study found that with only 363 images they were able to create object detection models with map values between 0.8255 and 0.99. Using transfer learning allowed their analysis to proceed significantly faster than if they had built a model from scratch. Some of the predictions that correctly identified an egg class contained very low confidence values. They sampled the pixel data within the bounding box to get RGB values for each egg. They then iterated through each egg by group membership and found the closest egg based on label and euclidean distance. Once tracking of individual eggs is possible, and can be mapped back to a single chicken, analysis could be conducted on that chicken's productivity automatically. (Jeremy Lubich, Kyle Thomas, and Daniel Engels 2019)

Eggs are one of the main agricultural products of the Philippines. Various manual processes that require hours of work add up to the stress and fatigue of the laborer. The implementation of this Egg Placing Machine to every poultry farm in the Philippines will boost production and profit. (Peterson Yongco 2019)

Eggs 'image was captured using an inexpensive yet reliable webcam which was loaded onto the MATLAB workspace for image processing and further image analysis. Results of this study showed 96.31% accuracy in estimating the egg's weight and classification validated by manual egg weighing and classification procedure. (Alphany ARAGUA 2018)

The size of eggs from commercial/transboundary breeds such as the Tsaiya and Pekin were comparable to reports of the same breeds in other countries. The distribution of mallard duck eggs by grade classification based on Haugh unit value was 21.17% Grade AA, 47.56% Grade A, 28.01% Grade B, and 3.26% Grade C. Eggs from the Pekin breed in Poland were also classified as GradeAA (73.50-84.10 HU) according to Kokoszyński et al. The Haugh unit is a measure of the viscosity of the thick albumen due to the high ovomucin content. (Orville L. Bondoc 2019)

The appearance, size, and weight of poultry meat and eggs are essential for production economics and vital in the poultry sector. These external characteristics influence their market price and consumers' preference and choice. With technological developments, there is an increase in the application and importance of vision systems in the agricultural sector. Computer vision has become a promising tool in the real-time automation of poultry weighing and processing systems. Owing to its noninvasive and nonintrusive nature and its capacity to present a wide range of information, computer vision systems can be applied in the size, mass, volume determination, and sorting and grading of poultry products. This review article gives a detailed summary of the current advances in measuring poultry products' external characteristics based on computer vision systems. An overview of computer vision systems is discussed and summarized. A comprehensive presentation of the application of computer vision-based systems for assessing poultry meat and eggs was provided, that is, weight and volume estimation, sorting, and classification. Finally, the challenges and potential future trends in size, weight, and volume estimation of poultry products are reported. (Qi Chao, Tchalla Korohou, Chen Kunjie 2021)

The differences in egg weight, shape dimensions, albumen weight, shell weight, and shell thickness among the four egg grades were small (P>0.05). Based on the median of Haugh unit values, the eggs from IP-Itim (60.70 HU), IP-Khaki (68.05 HU). Kayurnanggi-IP (66.45 HU) and White Mallard (61.00 Hu) were classified as Grade-A. Eggs from the Pekin breed in Poland were graded as GradeAA. Expiration dates may be placed on duck egg packages to indicate freshness or maximum time frame for quality. Haugh unit value could only be determined by the "breakout" method requiring special handling and costly equipment. Future experiments on the use of the new size classification and egg grading system will be important in breed improvement and conservation programs. (Rene C. Santiago2, Angelina R. Bustos3, Aldrin O. Ebron1 and Ana Rose Ramos 2018)

Software was developed for sizing Philippine table eggs and interfacing with microcontrollers.

To minimize the effect of aging on egg weight and subsequent accuracy, only fresh egg samples were used. The best weight estimate was obtained using the weight-to-projected area relationship above all the other parameters. (Quilloy, E. P.; Bato, P. M. 2018) 

2.2 Concept of the Study

Figure 2.1. Conceptual Framework

When the load cell detects the presence of an egg, the process starts. Its precise weight is determined and swiftly relayed to the microcontroller. Based on the egg weight, the relevant servo mechanism is signaled and sent to the proper storage using the smoothly powered conveyor belt. After the sorting process the sorted sizes will save in the database furthermore there is analytics in our system application that users can view the sorting percentage.

5 SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1 Summary

This chapter presents the summarized result of findings, proven conclusion, and recommendation.

This study aims to develop grading and classification of eggs equipped with HMI for poultry farms as it helps to ensure the quality and safety of eggs for consumers. Poultry farms that are equipped with Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) can use these systems to grade and classify eggs accurately and efficiently. HMIs allow for easy monitoring and control of the grading and classification process and can provide real-time data on the quality of eggs. By using HMIs, poultry farms can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their egg grading and classification processes, leading to increased profits and customer satisfaction.

The researcher has met the target goals, and we can tell that our system will be appealing, user-friendly, and well-liked by its users. Information from our database is available for viewing, including records of egg production and chicken productivity.

The system is reviewed according to the five criteria for functional suitability, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, and reliability by (10) respondents from San Mariano Isabela, who serves as our respondent. In the end, the respondents overwhelmingly supported the produced system's efficacy and thought it would be beneficial for their needs.

5.2 Conclusions
