1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background of the Study

Mangos and papayas are two tropical fruits of global economic significance. One of the
most important markers of plant life and possible illness is the condition of their leaves. The
production and quality of crops can be increased by using automated leaf health categorization to
help with early disease diagnosis and response. Plant leaf health classification is one of the image
classification problems where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated potential.

A farmer may cultivate many plants, but diseases can impede their growth. Disease attack
is one of the primary reasons that lead to plant loss. Each year 10–16% of plant production is
reduced due to disease. (Manhoor Khalid, et al., 2023).

In order to effectively control papaya and mango leaf diseases in the Philippines, it is
imperative to identify particular pathogens, such as begomoviruses for papaya leaf curl and
Colletotrichum for mango anthracnose. Leaf diseases that affect fruit production and export
competitiveness in the Philippines, such as begomovirus infections in papayas and anthracnose in
mangoes, have a major negative economic impact. This emphasizes the need for efficient
management strategies to maintain agriculture and market competitiveness.
To address the issue of papaya and mango leaf diseases in the Philippines, it is essential to
consider the potential causes and management strategies for these diseases. Several studies
provide valuable insights into the pathogens and factors contributing to leaf diseases in papaya and
mango plants. For instance, Colletotrichum species have been identified as the causative agents of
anthracnose in mangoes (Tovar-Pedraza et al., 2020), while begomoviruses have been associated

with leaf curl disease in papaya (Premchand et al., 2022). Additionally, the presence of pathogens

such as Colletotrichum asianum has been linked to anthracnose in Philippine mango cultivars
(Alvarez et al., 2020). These findings underscore the significance of understanding the specific
pathogens responsible for leaf diseases in papaya and mango plants in the Philippines.

Moreover, the impact of leaf diseases on the agricultural sector is noteworthy. Anthracnose,
a serious fungal disease affecting mangoes in the Philippines, has been reported to impact the
export of Carabao mangoes by accelerating ripening and reducing their price competitiveness in
the global market (Ilisan et al., 2020). Similarly, the occurrence of begomovirus infections in papaya
has been documented, highlighting the economic implications of these diseases on fruit production
(Nehra et al., 2019). These references emphasize the economic significance of addressing leaf
diseases in papaya and mango plants to ensure sustainable agricultural practices and market
competitiveness.

The potential of CNNs in disease identification is evident from studies such as Kandasamy
and Rajendran (2022), who developed a multilayer CNN for detecting anthracnose fungal disease
on mango leaves. Similarly, Nithya et al. (2022) utilized CNN for automated defect detection in
mangoes. These studies demonstrate the applicability of CNNs in identifying diseases affecting
mango leaves, which could be extended to include papaya leaves in the Philippines. The
incorporation of CNNs in the examination of papaya and mango leaves in the Philippines shows
great potential for identifying diseases, assessing nutritional content, and evaluating quality.
Through the application of CNNs, researchers and agricultural professionals can acquire valuable
insights into the health, composition, and possible uses of these leaves, thereby advancing
agricultural practices and crop management in the Philippines.

The application of MobileNet, a lightweight CNN model, for predicting papaya and mango
leaf diseases is backed by its effectiveness in disease detection, evident from its high accuracy in
identifying various plant diseases. Nevertheless, it's crucial to consider the computational resource
requirements of MobileNet during model development.

To develop a model for predicting papaya and mango leaf diseases using convolutional
neural networks (CNN), it is essential to consider the use of MobileNet, a lightweight CNN model.
MobileNet has been widely used in various applications, including disease detection in plants such
as papaya and mango leaves. The use of MobileNet in disease detection has shown promising
results in terms of accuracy and efficiency (Ma et al., 2022). Additionally, MobileNet has been
utilized in the detection of various plant diseases, including mango leaf diseases, with high
accuracy (S et al., 2022).

To predict papaya and mango leaf diseases using convolutional neural networks (CNN) with
the MobileNet model, several relevant references can be used to support this research. The study
by Sema (2023) demonstrates the successful use of a CNN to diagnose mango plant leaf disease
with an accuracy of 96.67%. Additionally, the work by Prabu and Chelliah (2022) presents the
identification and classification of mango leaf diseases using a CNN architecture, indicating the
applicability of CNN in disease prediction for mango leaves. Furthermore, Ma et al. (2022) discuss

However, it is important to note that MobileNet, like other CNN models, requires significant
computational resources such as memory and storage capacity (Sahlol et al., 2020). This aspect
should be considered when developing the model to ensure that the computational resources are
adequate for the implementation of MobileNet. Moreover, the use of MobileNet in the identification
of plant diseases, such as maize leaf diseases, has demonstrated high test accuracy, indicating the
effectiveness of MobileNet in disease identification (Ma et al., 2022). This highlights the potential of
MobileNet for accurately predicting papaya and mango leaf diseases.

It is important to note that while MobileNet has shown advantages in various applications, it
is not without limitations. For instance, it has been reported that although MobileNet is lighter than
other CNN models, it commonly achieves lower classification accuracy (Kim et al., 2022).
Additionally, in some cases, the overall recognition accuracy of other models, such as InceptionV3,
was slightly higher, but the recognition balance and model size of MobileNet were more
advantageous (Li et al., 2022). It is also worth noting that the performance of MobileNet has been
compared with that of other models in various contexts. For instance, in the classification of palm
tree diseases, the performance of MobileNet was found to be very close to that of other models,
with a minor advantage over others (Abu-Zanona et al., 2022). Similarly, in the context of image
classification, the precision value of the proposed MobileNet model was reported to be about

99.59%, indicating its superiority over other models (Venkatesh et al., 2021).

A study on bean leaf disease classification using MobileNet models demonstrated the
effectiveness of deep learning-based models for the classification and detection of plant leaf
diseases. Furthermore, Howard et al. (2017) highlighted the efficiency of MobileNets in building

lightweight deep neural networks, which is crucial for mobile vision applications. Furthermore,
Srinivasu et al. (2021) reported that mobile-net-based models exhibited better performance in
classifying the region of interest with minimal computational effort.

The architecture of MobileNet has been compared with other CNN models, and it has been
found to be statistically better in certain experiments, indicating its competitive performance in
specific contexts (Lacerda et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2021). Furthermore, MobileNet's efficiency has
been enhanced through techniques such as selective depth multipliers, local receptive field
expansion, and pointwise group convolution, further improving its capabilities (Wang et al., 2020;
Konaite et al., 2021).

According to (Nurhayati et al., 2022) Paddy is a rice-producing plant as a staple food raw
material for most of the population in Indonesia. The rice planting process cannot be separated
from pests and diseases that can cause crop failure and impact on rice production stocks.
Currently, the process of monitoring the development of rice plants is done conventionally by direct
observation by farmers. Meanwhile, in this paper, a classification model and determination of
object detection in rice plants infected with pests and diseases is proposed based on leaf color.
Leaf classification applies convolution conditional network algorithm with mobilenet as the

architecture and based on the study of (Sinha et al. 2019) In the field of computer, mobile and
embedded vision Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deep learning models which play a
significant role in object detection and recognition. MobileNet is one such efficient, light-weighted
model for this purpose, but there are many constraints or challenges for the hardware deployment
of such architectures into resource constrained micro-controller units due to limited memory, energy
and power. Also, the overall

accuracy of the model generally decreases when the size and the total number of parameters are
reduced by any method such as pruning or deep compression.

The efficiency of MobileNet in disease classification has been highlighted in various studies.
For instance, utilized optimal MobileNet-based convolutional neural networks for automated plant
leaf disease detection and classification (Ashwinkumar et al., 2022). Similarly, found that MobileNet
based models exhibited better performance in classifying diseases with minimal computational
efforts (Srinivasu et al., 2021).

Based on the relevant references, it is evident that the use of MobileNet models has been
widely explored in the classification of various plant diseases. For instance, Elfatimi et al. (2022)
and Zaki et al. (2020) have successfully employed MobileNet models in the classification of bean
leaf diseases and tomato leaf diseases, respectively. These studies demonstrated high accuracy
rates, indicating the effectiveness of MobileNet models in disease classification. Furthermore, Li et
al. (2022) highlighted the successful implementation of plant disease leaf detection on cell phones
through transfer learning on lightweight CNNs, including MobileNet. This suggests the potential for

MobileNet models to be utilized in mobile applications for leaf health classification.

Furthermore, the work of Howard et al. (2017) provided insights into the architecture of
MobileNets, emphasizing their efficiency in building lightweight deep neural networks. This
architectural advantage aligns with the requirements for deploying models in resource-constrained
environments, such as mobile devices, making MobileNet an attractive choice for leaf health
classification applications.

To classify mango and papaya leaf diseases in the Philippines, several studies have utilized
convolutional neural network (CNN) models for disease recognition and classification in various
plant species. For instance, Sema (2023) successfully diagnosed mango plant leaf disease with an
accuracy of 96.67% using a CNN trained on a specific dataset. Similarly, Waheed et al. (2020) and
S et al. (2022) developed optimized CNN models for disease recognition and classification in corn
and mango leaves, respectively. These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of CNN models in
accurately identifying and classifying plant leaf diseases.

The large amount of research on CNN models for the classification, detection, and
identification of plant leaf diseases highlights their efficacy and promise for precisely identifying
papaya and mango leaf diseases in the Philippines.

2.1.4 Diseases cause unhealthy leaves

The unhealthy leaves in mango and papaya plants can be attributed to various diseases,
including but not limited to red rust, anthracnose, powdery mildew, sooty mold, and leaf curl

diseases caused by begomoviruses. Fungi and viruses play a significant role in causing these
diseases, highlighting the importance of disease recognition and management strategies.

To understand the causes of unhealthy leaves in mango and papaya plants, it is essential to
consider the various diseases that affect these plants. Several studies have focused on the
identification and management of diseases affecting mango and papaya leaves. For instance, they
developed a technique for recognizing and classifying mango leaf diseases, including red rust,
anthracnose, powdery mildew, and sooty mold (Saleem et al., 2021). Similarly, they utilized
convolutional neural network models for the recognition of mango leaf diseases, incorporating

anthracnose, gall machi, powdery mildew, and red rust in their dataset (Rajbongshi et al., 2021).
These studies provide valuable insights into the specific diseases that can lead to unhealthy leaves
in mango plants.

In the case of papaya plants, this highlighted the significant implications of papaya leaf curl
disease (PaLCD) caused by begomovirus species, leading to substantial losses in papaya
production (Srivastava et al., 2022). Additionally, they reviewed the use of papaya leaves as a cure
for epidemic diseases, emphasizing the phytochemical composition and pharmacological attributes
of papaya leaves (Sharma et al., 2022). These references shed light on the diseases affecting
papaya plants and the potential therapeutic applications of papaya leaf extract.

To understand the causes of unhealthy leaves, it is essential to consider various factors
such as diseases, pests, and environmental stressors (Dai et al., 2021). found that Fusarium
proliferatum caused leaf curling and stem morbid elongation in rice, resulting in chlorosis and

unhealthy plants (Dai et al., 2021). Additionally, Cabuy et al. (2023) observed that a significant
proportion of Shorea palembanica leaves were unhealthy due to disease and insect pests (Cabuy
et al., 2023). Furthermore, Sullivan et al. (2018) highlighted the detrimental impact of lesions
bisecting the width of seagrass leaves on plant oxygen and nutrient transport, leading to unhealthy
plants (Sullivan et al., 2018).

Environmental factors also play a crucial role in leaf health. For instance, Kopaka et al.
(2021) discovered that high air humidity encourages Guignardia aesculi-caused leaf damage,
which results in unhealthy leaves. Additionally, Kenjabaev et al. (2020) noted that unhealthy
vegetation exhibits

Bachelor of Science in Computer Science

COLLEGE OF COMPUTING STUDIES, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY

lower photosynthetic activity, leading to increased visible reflectance and reduced near-infrared
reflectance from the vegetation (Kenjabaev et al., 2020).

The characteristics of unhealthy and healthy leaves play a crucial role in identifying plant
diseases and ensuring the overall well-being of plants. Several studies have focused on different
aspects of leaf characteristics to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy leaves. For instance,
Almadhor et al. (2021) utilized texture characteristics to identify plant leaf diseases, emphasizing
the use of machine learning for the detection of unhealthy regions on plant leaves. Similarly,
Pereira et al. (2021) applied proximal optical sensing to differentiate between healthy and
inoculated leaves, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach for early disease detection.
Furthermore, Martins et al. (2022) highlighted the influence of plant type and morphological
characteristics on leaf health, indicating that these factors are more influential than leaf size.

Based on the provided references, it is evident that the unhealthy leaf condition in papaya
and mango in the Philippines is primarily caused by fungal diseases such as anthracnose.
Anthracnose is a common postharvest fungal disease affecting mangoes and papayas, leading to
significant economic losses and impacting the export competitiveness of Carabao mangoes (Ilisan
et al., 2020; Sivakumar et al., 2021). The fungal pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is
identified as a major cause of anthracnose in mangoes and papayas (Nga & Bac, 2021; Sivakumar
et al., 2021). Additionally, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, another fungal pathogen, is associated with
dieback, gummosis, leaf spot, and fruit rot symptoms in mangoes and papayas (Rego et al., 2019).

In addition to fungal diseases, the presence of insect pests such as the oriental fruit fly and
the cecid fly has been reported in the Philippines, posing further challenges to mango and papaya

cultivation (Cortaga et al., 2022). Furthermore, the economic assessment of agroforestry systems
has indicated that certain combinations, such as Lemon-Pineapple-Papaya-Banana-Aroid, are
more productive, highlighting the importance of agroforestry practices in enhancing productivity
and disease management (Hasan et al., 2020; Rana, 2022).

In the Philippines, fungal diseases like anthracnose, which are caused by infections like
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Lasiodiplodia theobromae, are mostly to blame for the ill leaf
state of papaya and mango. Numerous approaches have been investigated to lessen the effects of
these illnesses, including the use of chitosan, papaya leaf extract, sophisticated technology for
disease detection, and agroforestry techniques. Mango and papaya quality preservation also
heavily depends on postharvest handling and storage techniques. In general, managing the

problems caused by unhealthy leaf conditions in the Philippines' papaya and mango crops requires
a multidisciplinary strategy that includes innovation in technology, disease control, and agricultural
methods.

2.3 Definition of Terms
Agriculture: It describes the practice of growing crops or raising animals. Someone who works as
a farmer is in the agriculture industry. The Latin root of agriculture is agri, or "field," plus cultura,
"cultivation." Cultivating a piece of land, or planting and growing food plants on it, is largely what
agriculture means.

Agroforestry: It is a farming or land management approach that combines growing trees or woody
plants with traditional agricultural crops or livestock in the same area.

Anthracnose: It is a fungal disease that affects a variety of plants, including trees, shrubs, and
crops. It typically causes dark lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits, leading to wilting and, in severe
cases, defoliation. Warm and wet conditions often favor anthracnose development. Management
strategies involve pruning infected parts, applying fungicides, and maintaining proper plant hygiene

to reduce the spread of the disease.

Begomovirus: It refers to a group of plant viruses that are transmitted by whiteflies. The viruses
mainly affect dicotyledonous plants, including many economically important crops such as
tomatoes, peppers, and beans. Begomoviruses can cause symptoms like leaf curling, yellowing,
and stunted growth, leading to significant agricultural losses. Effective management often involves
controlling the whitefly vectors and implementing disease-resistant crop varieties. If you were
referring to a different term, please provide more context or clarification.

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides: It is a specific species of fungus that can make plants sick. It's a
type of pathogen that causes a plant disease known as anthracnose. When plants get infected with
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, you might see symptoms like dark spots, lesions, or other damage

on their leaves, fruits, or other parts. So, in simple terms, it's a fungus that can harm plants by
causing anthracnose, which shows up as visible problems on the plant's surface.

Chitosan: It is a special material made from the shells of sea creatures. People use it in various
ways, such as in agriculture to help plants grow, in water treatment to remove impurities, and even
in some dietary supplements. It's like a versatile natural ingredient that finds applications in different
areas due to its useful characteristics.

Convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet): It is a network architecture for deep learning
that learns directly from data. CNNs are particularly useful for finding patterns in images to
recognize objects, classes, and categories. They can also be quite effective for classifying audio,
time-series, and signal data.

Crop: It is a plant or plant product that can be grown and harvested for profit or

subsistence. Dataset: It is a collection of examples.

Healthy leaf: If your plant grows well, the leaves will look good too. Leaves shouldn't hang, curl, or
discolor.

Inoculated leaves: These are plant leaves deliberately exposed to tiny organisms like bacteria or
fungi. Scientists do this to study how plants react to infections, helping them learn about diseases
and find ways to protect plants.

Lasiodiplodia theobromae: It is a type of fungus that can cause problems for plants. It's a plant
pathogen, meaning it can make plants sick. This fungus is known to cause diseases in various

crops

and trees. When plants are infected with Lasiodiplodia theobromae, you might notice symptoms like
wilting, cankers, or rotting of plant parts.

Leaf curl: It refers to a physiological response or a symptom seen in plants where the leaves
exhibit abnormal curling or distortion. This condition can be caused by various factors, including
environmental stress, pests, diseases, or genetic factors.

Machine learning It is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on
the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its
accuracy.

MobileNet: It is a type of convolutional neural network designed for mobile and embedded vision
applications.

Model: It is the output of training a machine learning algorithm.

Powdery mildew: It is a fungal disease that affects various plants, forming a white powdery
substance on the leaves, stems, and sometimes flowers. It thrives in warm, dry conditions and can
impact a plant's health by hindering photosynthesis. Control measures may include fungicides,
pruning affected areas, and promoting good air circulation around plants.

Prediction: It is what someone thinks will happen. A prediction is a forecast, but not only about the
weather. Pre means "before,” and diction has to do with talking. So a prediction

is a statement about the future. It's a guess, sometimes based on facts or evidence, but not always.

Proximal optical sensing: It means using close-up optical devices to check things without
touching them. For instance, in farming, it's like using special cameras up close to quickly see how
healthy crops are or check their nutrients without getting too close.

Red rust: Is the reddish-brown color you see on metal when it gets rusty. It happens because the
metal reacts with air and water. This rust can make the metal weaker over time. People use
coatings or rust-resistant materials to stop it from happening.

Sooty mold: It is a dark, powdery fungus that grows on the honeydew secretions of sap-feeding
insects like aphids, scale insects, or whiteflies. It forms a black coating on surfaces such as leaves,
stems, or fruit, negatively impacting the affected plant by blocking sunlight and hindering
photosynthesis. While the mold itself does not directly harm plants, it can indirectly affect their
health and appearance.

Unhealthy Plant: The symptoms of an unhealthy plant are expressed as visible changes in its
appearance.
