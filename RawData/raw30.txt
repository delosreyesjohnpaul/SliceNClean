CHAPTER I

INTRODUCTION

Project Context

Technologies are a regular part of the lives of most teachers and students in the world today, as Naismith & Sharples (2018) stated. The A-star algorithm in this project is fundamental because it is critical to completing it. Based on the study of (Franti≈°ek et al., 2018) A-star algorithm is one of the best-known path planning algorithms, which can be applied to metric or topological configuration space. This algorithm combines heuristic searching and searching based on the shortest path.

In the fast progress of the world today, applications in a small compact device or mobile phone are much easier than using any significant materials and equipment. The researchers will be conducting a study using an A-star Algorithm for the mapping guide application in Isabela State University Cauayan Campus.

Moreover, several existing technologies require the same processes, including situations that solve significant problems like finding the shortest way to locate the building. This procedure requires specific innovation for proper time relevance, hassle-free thinking, and real-time accuracy.

Some students, especially newcomers to the campus, lack the confidence to ask others where the exact location they want to go, and also those students who are having a hard time because of their disabilities. According to Akintoye (2019), the primary purpose of school mapping is to work out a program that will enhance the expansion of educational facilities, taking into consideration the regional inequalities and financial requirements, such as the provision of vocational and technical components of primary, secondary, and tertiary schools.

Research Gap

As presented in the following literature and studies in Chapter 2, much of this research is based on the A-star algorithm, which is very flexible in problem-solving, GPS mapping, and even general planning. However, only some of these studies are based on developing flexible environment Based GPS guides for people who use their phones for their daily uses. That is why the researchers of this study will be conducting a project based on developing a School Mapping Guide using an A-star pathfinding algorithm for Isabela State University Campuses.

Objectives of the Study

The main objective of this study was to develop a School Mapping Guide Application using A-Star Algorithm for Isabela State University Campuses to serve the students in a more effective way in locating buildings inside the school vicinity.

Specifically, it aimed to:

1. determine the problems encountered in looking for the location of the campuses, buildings, and teacher information from students;

2. determine the features of the application in the use of the system;

3. evaluate an application in terms of functionality, usability, content, reliability, and performance of the developed system by adopting the ISO 9126 system development criteria.

Scope and Limitation

This project aimed to create a school mapping guide application using A-Star Algorithm for Isabela State University Campus. The focus of this study was to provide a map that shows the location of the campuses and gives the direction or a waypoint from your location to the selected campus. Hence you could see the different locations of buildings inside the campus, which also indicates the name of the building and other information. The application has the teacher's info on every campus to help new students know the information of their instructors.

The Visual Studio code powers this project for the software requirements and the PC desktop for hardware requirements. The system to be developed is to be available for mobile and pc use, so it is applicable for all Android and Windows pc devices, but there are also some limitations in this system. It depends on the quality and capacity of mobile phones and pe that could access the system as an application.





CHAPTER II

Review of Related Literature and Studies

In this section, you will read about the different literature the researchers have read that are directly related to their study. This literature helps the researchers to have a more transparent background in developing the School Mapping Guide Application Using the A-Star Algorithm.

Mapping Systems

In the fast progress of the world today, applications in small compact devices or mobile phones are much handier than using any significant materials and equipment. Mobile technologies are a regular part of the lives of most teachers and students today, as Naismith & Sharples (2017) stated. The specific uses of this device are very complex and broad, which is why it is convenient. For example, it can be used in social networking (William, 2019). Mobile phones are ubiquitous, social networks are widely used, cities are increasingly connected, and the mobility of people and goods has risen globally. The other one is for Tracking, Locating, Mapping, or GPS. According to (Ricardo, 2018), recent advancements in smartphones and Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies present new opportunities to track travelers' trips.

Introducing Algorithms

Given the widespread use of cell phones, it makes sense to use smartphone data as a trustworthy source for personal travel diaries. Additionally, practically everyone in today's society owns a mobile phone, making them a rising digital tool. This study aimed to determine whether or not phones have an impact on specific algorithms used in problem- solving (Marcus, 2019). According to (Wang et al., 2018), algorithms are a crucial topic in computer science since they aid software developers in developing practical and error-free programs. Having algorithms in software is, therefore, very necessary in problem processing.

Importance of Algorithm

Because there are several variations and uses for algorithms, each algorithm has a specific purpose for problem-solving or completing a task. Additionally, an algorithm describes the sequential procedures and actions that must be used to solve a problem. Although many different algorithms may be created to tackle various issues, we consider the following algorithms crucial in programming (Hazas. et al., 2021).

Algorithms used for GPS

Many studies have employed GPS-based data in planning and demand analysis, but mobile phone GPS data has yet to get much attention. In this study, the algorithm is focused on solving the waypoint, position, or actual GPS functions. The option to investigate the potential of the Google Location History (GLH) data is provided (Renz, 2018). The chance represents a significant advancement in the study's progress. Based on research by (Barberis et al., 2019), indoor positioning is a crucial one that is developing quickly along with the rise of IoT and the digitization of large cities. Finding and developing a suitable technology to condense nonlinearities from multipath propagation is the goal of this endeavor. Our system's ability to locate the user is one of its most crucial functions. The significance of having technology that can gather, analyze, distribute, and receive data is therefore crucial. loT, or the Internet of Things, is designed for that. Even if loT has already altered the globe, its potential is still untapped. IoT network technologies are the component of the loT that enable data transmission and reception (Chen et al., 2019). These advantages can be obtained without increasing transmit power or bandwidth but typically come at the cost of a more sophisticated system at the transmitter and receiver ends stated (Joseph, 2018).

Introduction to A-star(A*) Algorithm

Because it is essential to finish the project, the A-star algorithm must be used in this endeavor. Based on research by Frantiek et al. (2018), the A method is one of the most well-known path-planning algorithms. It may be used for metric or topological configuration spaces and combines heuristic and shortest-path searching. As a result, one of the most well-known path-planning algorithms is the A algorithm. However, the conventional A algorithm has certain drawbacks, including slow planning speed and proximity to obstacles (Marmasse et al., 2022). Basic Theta and Phi algorithms also leverage the concept of searching from all directions. Basic Theta is an extension of the A algorithm that measures the visibility of cells between them (Phanikanth et al., 2019). According to (Rouse, 2018), the robustness and speed of the planned path are the primary indicators of the A algorithm's performance. There are still important things that could be improved in the A* algorithm despite extensive research by academics. The research team may employ algorithms for problem-solving and troubleshooting to address any flaws that may have occurred throughout the project's development. Path planning algorithms use various classification techniques depending on the environmental information., there are numerous classification techniques for path-planning algorithms (Alija, 2019).

System optimizations are helpful since they give the system the stability and accuracy it needs to function. In order to evaluate the value of land in terms of appropriateness or cost for a particular use, planners involved in locational decision- making frequently employ raster-based geographic information systems (GIS) (Tesoriero, 2018). However, even with these algorithms' improved capabilities, real-time path planning still needs to be attainable. These algorithms continue to use intricate grid maps (Johnny, 2018). Additionally, path planning in a static environment assumes that the robot can sense its surroundings and applies local path-planning techniques when it cannot fully comprehend them. Based on knowledge of the barriers present in the static environment, A* is utilized to determine the shortest path (Segunda, 2018). According to (David, 2022) Dijkstra algorithm uses a greedy technique for path planning, although other algorithms like A- star accomplish the same task. It is employed to locate the graph's shortest path. It needs to formally pay regard to the pragmatism of the answer to be interested in finding the quickest path. The A* algorithm can therefore design the shortest way on the map, but it must navigate around the path nodes and choose the least expensive path (Celli,2019).

The heuristic function (Elton, 2019) claimed that the heuristic function directs the A* algorithm to seek the shortest path. This is one of the functions of the A-star algorithm that helps it function very well. The Manhattan, Euclidean, and Diagonal distances are designed in later research and are used in the heuristic function of the conventional A* algorithm. The algorithm uses the heuristic function to determine the path's cost before planning it. Scholars have conducted a substantial study on the efficiency optimization of the A algorithm. We focus on the efficiency and resilience of the method, among other research accomplishments related to the A algorithm. The efficiency issue of the algorithm is addressed via an A* optimization method through two improvements. To increase the trustworthiness of the heuristic function, the evaluation function is first weighted (Barnouti, 2018). According to a study by (Cardei et al., 2019), most A-star algorithms are used for autonomous vehicles, which are highly helpful for the community. The field of autonomous vehicles is constantly increasing, and there is a significant demand for reliable and effective path planners. Using two approaches a two-step path planning and path smoothing approach and a method based on an optimal control formulation of the path planning problem-we tackle the global path-planning problem for an autonomous load carrier for quarry environments developed at Volvo Construction Equipment. Static path planning is another name for global path planning.

In contrast, local path planning, also known as dynamic path planning, is most frequently carried out in ambiguous or dynamic contexts (Narzt et al., 2018). As a result, the two-step strategy is based on smoothing an initial path discovered by the effective grid search algorithm A* by fitting a curve with the fewest possible clothoid segmentations to the A path. The smoothing is accomplished by linearizing the deviation restrictions around the curvature of the A* path and rewriting the non-linear optimization problem in a convex form (Kirsten, 2018). The technique, nevertheless, makes the algorithm's calculations more complex. To improve the A* storage approach, academics concentrate on node storage. While the standard A* technique requires traversing numerous nodes to finish the search process, the storage method has to search the node's sequence number to access the array element (Cooper, 2019).

The ultimate result of this project will be advantageous to the user because it will locate the destination of the user's chosen place. The EBS-A* algorithm, an improved path- planning method for mobile robots based on the traditional A* algorithm, is proposed in work (Aesther, 2022). This approach overcame the shortcomings of the traditional A* algorithm in terms of path robustness and path planning effectiveness by utilizing the three strategies of expansion distance, bidirectional search, and smoothing. It will be possible to finish the investigation with the help of the A-star algorithm. The A algorithm was selected because, according to (Wood, 2018), it embodies the fundamental algorithms utilized in modern real-time path planning solutions in a static setting. To improve this algorithm's performance and efficiency, new research builds on it. The researchers of this project hope to complete the study based on earlier research that can benefit the project's success.

Framework Conditions

According to (Angelo, 2018), management systems are tools for dealing with complexity. It entails setting goals, accounting for the framework's requirements, deriving actions and measures from the goals, and dependably completing tasks via various processes and roles.

Officer Profile Management System Using by Cloud Computing Services 

The challenges of designing DBMS data-flow control systems in a distributed centralized information center were covered in the article by Jorgan (2018). The design of the application of a comparable system is being taken into consideration to create an open cloud platform a high-performance machine utilized for clustering database servers' massive data analysis. Theoretical concepts and ideas for a hybrid interface application used to manage officer profiles have been created and achieved.

GPS Localization Accuracy Classification: A Context-Based Approach

According to (Verma, 2018), the localization of the Global Positioning System (GPS) has recently piqued interest in a variety of disciplines, including collision avoidance, intelligent transportation systems (ITSS), navigation systems, road tolling, and smart parking. Even though several techniques for improving localization accuracy have been discussed in the literature, more efficient solutions that can partially credit the localization process are still needed. By using these actions, localization systems can manage the localization process and resources at their disposal, achieving the best accuracy feasible while minimizing the adverse effects of insufficient precision on the intended application. Any GPS's localization accuracy is strongly influenced by the method for calculating positions and environmental measurement conditions. The measuring conditions in their environment still have a considerable impact, even though localization approaches have lately started to demonstrate a significant improvement in localization performance. The impact of measurement conditions on localization accuracy could be a better-conditioned problem in and of itself due to the incongruent character of the measurement process. The method for calculating localization accuracy is suggested in this paper. The two steps of this technique are improved location accuracy classification and measurement condition disambiguation. The effectiveness of the suggested approach for categorizing GPS localization accuracy under various measurement settings is shown by comparing real- world studies.

Academic institutions and R&D organizations gather, curate, and arrange research- related activities from various sources (Sayyad et al., 2016). In academic institutions, the faculty Profile System sometimes referred to as the Research Information Management System, is essential for managing data related to scholarly communication. The Faculty Profile System's collection of research-related metadata can be used for several things, such as rating research institutes, evaluating faculty and departmental research, and allocating funds. The study's objectives are to use the Indian Research Information Network System (IRINS) to build a faculty profile management system for seven IITs and to use bibliometric indicators to assess faculty members' contributions to research. The study aimed to evaluate seven IITs' research output based on publications and citations from 2010 to 2019.

Candidate or employee selection is the method of choosing a new hire who is best suited for the open position (Padmaraj, 2012). The hiring process's steps depend on the position you are filling, your budget for recruiting, the level of seniority required for the role, the resources you have available, and your organization's needs.

Locator Map using A-star algorithm

In order to save time and money, locater maps are created to help people get to specific locations. The locator map's usefulness improves the awareness, satisfaction, productivity, and accessibility (Pathak et al., 2016). The locator map's usefulness improves the awareness, satisfaction, productivity, and accessibility (Justin et al., 2016). Locator Maps are a valuable addition to campus initiatives. Finding specific locations is still a typical issue. The map is made to lessen the burden. Different types of maps are created for various types of regions. Despite this, some regions still require navigational maps (Severin, 2018).

Mobile Location Campus Map

In recent years, mobile phones have made tremendous advancements in memory capacity, computing capacities, and better hardware characteristics. We can now refer to this age as the era of smartphones because mobile phones have become an essential requirement for people. Mobile phones have advanced functions and can execute sophisticated tasks (Lester, 2015). Portable computers (also known as mobile computers) and wireless communication are two significant and crucial technologies that have given consumers access to computing power and network resources. At the same time, they travel from one location to another. People may now access files and data whenever and wherever they want, thanks to the trend of smaller PCs and higher wireless network capacity. Using any form of computer in a moving setting is referred to as "mobile computing" (Escobar, 2015).

However, context-aware computing is a mobile computing paradigm in which an application can find and utilize contextual data, such as the user's location, time of day, adjacent locations and activities, and user activity (Hendrix, 2015). Location is one of the most often utilized contexts in context-aware computing, as humans and mobile devices regularly move locations. Using presence technology, location awareness allows a user or application to get information about a device's precise location (Chaimowicz, 2017).

In order to make computers available everywhere while remaining invisible to users, the research team at Olivetti Research Limited (ORLXeron)'s PARC laboratory pioneered the context-aware computing field under the idea of ubiquitous, known as pervasive computing. Since then, researchers have become more interested in this topic and have added to it (Arado, 2017).

Importance of Location Awareness

According to (Luther, 2018), location and context awareness go hand in hand. They claimed that context could be used more flexibly with mobile computing with any moving entities, especially with bearers of intelligent communicators. In contrast, the location could be a determining factor for resident processes. However, (Culler, 2016) defined context awareness in terms of active context awareness (a situation where an application automatically adapts to discovered context by changing the application's behavior) and passive context awareness (whereby an application presents the new or updated context to an interested user or makes the context persistent for the user to retrieve later). The idea of location awareness is the ability to sense and respond to a changing environment. As a critical element of context, location has been the subject of several studies over the years, with particular attention paid to location-sensing technologies, location-aware application support, and location-based applications. Numerous businesses have used the idea of location awareness to create navigational systems and context-aware map apps (Richard, 2017).

Indoor Locator using A-star Pathfinder

The Global Positioning System (GPS) was cited as an example of a technology employed in many modern applications. One of the applications tracks your car and keeps an eye on it frequently. With the help of this tracking device, you may see the location and route taken by the car from any other distant point. It also includes an online application that gives you the target's precise position. (Patel, 2016).

A dynamic electronic map that directs people around campus is called a campus map application. It should be able to conduct navigational tasks, display the user's current location, recognize their points of interest (POI), describe those POI in some detail, and, most significantly, be user-friendly. The campus map application comprises locating objects and displaying a map with their location or direction. Users using GPS programs can enter a destination, and the program then displays the quickest route based on their current coordinates (Cardei et al., 2013). Google Maps and Google Navigation display navigational information. Different types of navigation, including bus routes, driving instructions, walking directions, and bicycling directions, have started to be incorporated into technology as it develops (Kincaid, 2015). Kincaid and Marissa stated that over the past few years, Google Maps and GPS devices have developed into essential tools for people who need directions (Mihaela, 2016).

Location Awareness inside Universities

Their potential has yet to be fully utilized on college campuses. Because directions within campuses cannot be found using Google Maps, this effort aims to provide them on mobile devices. This is because many location-aware mobile technologies are successfully used in mobile applications (Misra, 2018). Finding specific buildings on campus can be very difficult, especially for someone unfamiliar with the school, because most of our universities have a permanent campus map at their main entrance that needs to be updated (Vasilev, 2016). The system was created to deliver the highest level of usability, a fantastic user interface, and, most importantly, accurate data (Kincaid, 2015). A feature of presence technology called location awareness provides details on the precise location of a device. (Sarah, 2016).
